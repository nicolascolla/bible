Ὅτι ἐποίησας τοῦτο,
ἐπικατάρατος σὺ ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν κτηνῶν καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων
τῶν θηρίων τῆς γῆς·

καὶ τῇ κοιλίᾳ πορεύσῃ
καὶ γῆν φάγῃ πάσας
τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου.<br/><br/>

καὶ πρὸς τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἡ ἀποστροφή σου,
καὶ αὐτός σου κυριεύσει.<br/><br/>

And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pains and your groanings; in pain you shall bring forth children, and your submission shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.<br/><br/>

Ὅτι ἤκουσας τῆς φωνῆς τῆς γυναικός σου
καὶ ἔφαγες ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου,
οὗ ἐνετειλάμην σοι τούτου μόνου μὴ φαγεῖν ἀπ' αὐτοῦ,
ἐπικατάρατος ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις σου·
ἐν λύπαις φάγῃ αὐτὴν πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ζωῆς σου·

28. ἐὰν δὲ ἐλαττονωθῶσιν οἱ πεντήκοντα δίκαιοι πέντε, ἀπολεῖς ἕνεκεν τῶν πέντε πᾶσαν τὴν πόλιν; καὶ εἶπεν Οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω, ἐὰν εὕρω ἐκεῖ τεσσαράκοντα πέντε.<br/>But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, will you destroy the whole city because of the five [wanting]? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.<br/><br/>
29. καὶ προσέθηκεν ἔτι λαλῆσαι πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἶπεν Ἑὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ τεσσαράκοντα; καὶ εἶπεν Οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν τεσσαράκοντα.<br/>And he continued to speak to him still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the forty's sake.<br/><br/>

And he said, I will not destroy it for the thirty's sake.<br/><br/>
31. καὶ εἶπεν Ἑπειδὴ ἔχω λαλῆσαι πρὸς τὸν κύριον, ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ εἴκοσι; καὶ εἶπεν Οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν εἴκοσι.<br/>And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.<br/><br/>
32. καὶ εἶπεν Μή τι, κύριε, ἐὰν λαλήσω ἔτι ἅπαξ· ἐὰν δὲ εὑρεθῶσιν ἐκεῖ δέκα; καὶ εἶπεν Οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσω ἕνεκεν τῶν δέκα.<br/>And he said, Will there be anything [against me], Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.<br/><br/>
33. ἀπῆλθεν δὲ κύριος, ὡς ἐπαύσατο λαλῶν τῷ Αβρααμ, καὶ Αβρααμ ἀπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.<br/>And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place.<br/><br/>

Ἦλθον δὲ οἱ δύο ἄγγελοι εἰς Σοδομα ἑσπέρας· Λωτ δὲ ἐκάθητο παρὰ τὴν πύλην Σοδομων. ἰδὼν δὲ Λωτ ἐξανέστη εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτοῖς καὶ προσεκύνησεν τῷ προσώπῳ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν<br/>And the two angels came to Sodom at evening. And Lot sat by the gate of Sodom, and Lot having seen them, rose up to meet them, and he worshiped with his face to the ground, and said,

[my] lords, turn aside to the house of your servant, and rest from your journey, and wash your feet, and having risen early in the morning you shall depart on your journey. And they said, Nay, but we will lodge in the street.<br/><br/>
3. καὶ κατεβιάζετο αὐτούς, καὶ ἐξέκλιναν πρὸς αὐτὸν καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν αὐτοῦ. καὶ ἐποίησεν αὐτοῖς πότον, καὶ ἀζύμους ἔπεψεν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἔφαγον.<br/>And he constrained them, and they turned aside to him, and they entered into his house, and he made a feast for them, and baked unleavened cakes for them, and they did eat.<br/><br/>

5. καὶ ἐξεκαλοῦντο τὸν Λωτ καὶ ἔλεγον πρὸς αὐτόν Ποῦ εἰσιν οἱ ἄνδρες οἱ εἰσελθόντες πρὸς σὲ τὴν νύκτα; ἐξάγαγε αὐτοὺς πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ἵνα συγγενώμεθα αὐτοῖς.<br/>And they called out Lot, and said to him, Where are the men that went in to you this night? bring them out to us that we may be with them.<br/><br/>
6. ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Λωτ πρὸς αὐτοὺς πρὸς τὸ πρόθυρον, τὴν δὲ θύραν προσέῳξεν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Lot went out to them to the porch, and he shut the door after him,
7. εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς Μηδαμῶς, ἀδελφοί, μὴ πονηρεύσησθε.<br/>and said to them, By no means, brethren, do not act villainously.<br/><br/>
8. εἰσὶν δέ μοι δύο θυγατέρες, αἳ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν ἄνδρα· ἐξάξω αὐτὰς πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ χρήσασθε αὐταῖς, καθὰ ἂν ἀρέσκῃ ὑμῖν· μόνον εἰς τοὺς ἄνδρας τούτους μὴ ποιήσητε μηδὲν ἄδικον, οὗ εἵνεκεν εἰσῆλθον ὑπὸ τὴν σκέπην τῶν δοκῶν μου.<br/>But I have two daughters, who have not known a man. I will bring them out to you, and you use them as it may please you, only do no injury to these men, to avoid which they came under the shelter of my roof.<br/><br/>
9. εἶπαν δέ Ἀπόστα ἐκεῖ. εἷς ἦλθες παροικεῖν· μὴ καὶ κρίσιν κρίνειν; νῦν οὖν σὲ κακώσομεν μᾶλλον ἢ ἐκείνους. καὶ παρεβιάζοντο τὸν ἄνδρα τὸν Λωτ σφόδρα καὶ ἤγγισαν συντρῖψαι τὴν θύραν.<br/>And they said to him, Stand back there, you came in to sojourn, was it also to judge? Now then we would harm you more than them. And they pressed hard on the man, even Lot, and they drew nigh to break the door.<br/><br/>
10. ἐκτείναντες δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τὰς χεῖρας εἰσεσπάσαντο τὸν Λωτ πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ οἴκου ἀπέκλεισαν·<br/>And the men stretched forth their hands and drew Lot in to them into the house, and shut the door of the house.<br/><br/>

12. Εἶπαν δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες πρὸς Λωτ Ἔστιν τίς σοι ὧδε, γαμβροὶ ἢ υἱοὶ ἢ θυγατέρες; ἢ εἴ τίς σοι ἄλλος ἔστιν ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἐξάγαγε ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου·<br/>And the men said to Lot, Have you here sons-in-law, or sons or daughters, or if you have any other friend in the city, bring them out of this place.<br/><br/>
13. ὅτι ἀπόλλυμεν ἡμεῖς τὸν τόπον τοῦτον, ὅτι ὑψώθη ἡ κραυγὴ αὐτῶν ἐναντίον κυρίου, καὶ ἀπέστειλεν ἡμᾶς κύριος ἐκτρῖψαι αὐτήν.<br/>For we are going to destroy this place; for their cry has been raised up before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.<br/><br/>
14. ἐξῆλθεν δὲ Λωτ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πρὸς τοὺς γαμβροὺς αὐτοῦ τοὺς εἰληφότας τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ εἶπεν Ἀνάστητε καὶ ἐξέλθατε ἐκ τοῦ τόπου τούτου, ὅτι ἐκτρίβει κύριος τὴν πόλιν. ἔδοξεν δὲ γελοιάζειν ἐναντίον τῶν γαμβρῶν αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law who had married his daughters, and said, Rise up, and depart out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city; but he seemed to be speaking absurdly before his sons-in-law.<br/><br/>
15. ἡνίκα δὲ ὄρθρος ἐγίνετο, ἐπεσπούδαζον οἱ ἄγγελοι τὸν Λωτ λέγοντες Ἀναστὰς λαβὲ τὴν γυναῖκά σου καὶ τὰς δύο θυγατέρας σου, ἃς ἔχεις, καὶ ἔξελθε, ἵνα μὴ συναπόλῃ ταῖς ἀνομίαις τῆς πόλεως.<br/>But when it was morning, the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise and take your wife, and your two daughters whom you hast, and go forth; lest you also be destroyed with the iniquities of the city.<br/><br/>
16. καὶ ἐταράχθησαν· καὶ ἐκράτησαν οἱ ἄγγελοι τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῆς χειρὸς τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν χειρῶν τῶν δύο θυγατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ φείσασθαι κύριον αὐτοῦ.<br/>And they were troubled, and the angels laid hold on his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, in that the Lord spared him.<br/><br/>
17. καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐξήγαγον αὐτοὺς ἔξω. καὶ εἶπαν Σῴζων σῷζε τὴν σεαυτοῦ ψυχήν· μὴ περιβλέψῃς εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω μηδὲ στῇς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ περιχώρῳ· εἰς τὸ ὄρος σῴζου, μήποτε συμπαραλημφθῇς.<br/>And it came to pass when they brought them out, that they said, Save your own life by all means; look not round to that which is behind, nor stay in all the country round about, escape to the mountain, lest perhaps you be overtaken together with them.<br/><br/>
18. εἶπεν δὲ Λωτ πρὸς αὐτούς Δέομαι, κύριε·<br/>And Lot said to them, I pray, Lord,
19. ἐπειδὴ εὗρεν ὁ παῖς σου ἔλεος ἐναντίον σου καὶ ἐμεγάλυνας τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου, ὃ ποιεῖς ἐπ' ἐμέ, τοῦ ζῆν τὴν ψυχήν μου, ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ δυνήσομαι διασωθῆναι εἰς τὸ ὄρος, μὴ καταλάβῃ με τὰ κακὰ καὶ ἀποθάνω,<br/>since your servant has found mercy before you, and you have magnified your righteousness, in what you do towards me that my soul may live,-- but I shall not be able to escape to the mountain, lest perhaps the calamity overtake me and I die.<br/><br/>
20. ἰδοὺ ἡ πόλις αὕτη ἐγγὺς τοῦ καταφυγεῖν με ἐκεῖ, ἥ ἐστιν μικρά, ἐκεῖ σωθήσομαι· οὐ μικρά ἐστιν; καὶ ζήσεται ἡ ψυχή μου.<br/>Behold this city is near for me to escape thither, which is a small one, and there shall I be preserved, is it not little? and my soul shall live because of you.<br/><br/>
21. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἰδοὺ ἐθαύμασά σου τὸ πρόσωπον καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ ῥήματι τούτῳ τοῦ μὴ καταστρέψαι τὴν πόλιν, περὶ ἧς ἐλάλησας·<br/>And he said to him, Behold, I have had respect to you also about this thing, that I should not overthrow the city about which you have spoken.<br/><br/>
22. σπεῦσον οὖν τοῦ σωθῆναι ἐκεῖ· οὐ γὰρ δυνήσομαι ποιῆσαι πρᾶγμα ἕως τοῦ σε εἰσελθεῖν ἐκεῖ. διὰ τοῦτο ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως ἐκείνης Σηγωρ.<br/>Hasten therefore to escape thither, for I shall not be able to do anything until you are come thither; therefore he called the name of that city, Segor.<br/><br/>
23. ὁ ἥλιος ἐξῆλθεν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ Λωτ εἰσῆλθεν εἰς Σηγωρ,<br/>The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot entered into Segor.<br/><br/>
24. καὶ κύριος ἔβρεξεν ἐπὶ Σοδομα καὶ Γομορρα θεῖον καὶ πῦρ παρὰ κυρίου ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ<br/>And the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrha brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.<br/><br/>
25. καὶ κατέστρεψεν τὰς πόλεις ταύτας καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν περίοικον καὶ πάντας τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν καὶ πάντα τὰ ἀνατέλλοντα ἐκ τῆς γῆς.<br/>And he overthrew these cities, and all the country round about, and all that dwelt in the cities, and the plants springing out of the ground.<br/><br/>
26. καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω καὶ ἐγένετο στήλη ἁλός.<br/>And his wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.<br/><br/>
27. Ὤρθρισεν δὲ Αβρααμ τὸ πρωῒ εἰς τὸν τόπον, οὗ εἱστήκει ἐναντίον κυρίου,<br/>And Abraam rose up early to go to the place, where he had stood before the Lord.<br/><br/>
28. καὶ ἐπέβλεψεν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον Σοδομων καὶ Γομορρας καὶ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον τῆς γῆς τῆς περιχώρου καὶ εἶδεν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ἀνέβαινεν φλὸξ τῆς γῆς ὡσεὶ ἀτμὶς καμίνου.<br/>And he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrha, and towards the surrounding country, and saw, and behold a flame went up from the earth, as the smoke of a furnace.<br/><br/>
29. καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἐκτρῖψαι κύριον πάσας τὰς πόλεις τῆς περιοίκου ἐμνήσθη ὁ θεὸς τοῦ Αβρααμ καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν τὸν Λωτ ἐκ μέσου τῆς καταστροφῆς ἐν τῷ καταστρέψαι κύριον τὰς πόλεις, ἐν αἷς κατῴκει ἐν αὐταῖς Λωτ.<br/>And it came to pass that when God destroyed all the cities of the region round about, God remembered Abraam, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when the Lord overthrew those cities in which Lot dwelt.<br/><br/>
30. Ἀνέβη δὲ Λωτ ἐκ Σηγωρ καὶ ἐκάθητο ἐν τῷ ὄρει καὶ αἱ δύο θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ μετ' αὐτοῦ· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ κατοικῆσαι ἐν Σηγωρ. καὶ ᾤκησεν ἐν τῷ σπηλαίῳ, αὐτὸς καὶ αἱ δύο θυγατέρες αὐτοῦ μετ' αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Lot went up out of Segor, and dwelt in the mountain, he and his two daughters with him, for he feared to dwell in Segor; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters with him.<br/><br/>
31. εἶπεν δὲ ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν νεωτέραν Ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν πρεσβύτερος, καὶ οὐδείς ἐστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὃς εἰσελεύσεται πρὸς ἡμᾶς, ὡς καθήκει πάσῃ τῇ γῇ·<br/>And the elder said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no one on the earth who shall come in to us, as it is fit in all the earth.<br/><br/>
32. δεῦρο καὶ ποτίσωμεν τὸν πατέρα ἡμῶν οἶνον καὶ κοιμηθῶμεν μετ' αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα.<br/>Come and let us make our father drink wine, and let us sleep with him, and let us raise up seed from our father.<br/><br/>
33. ἐπότισαν δὲ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ταύτῃ, καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα ἡ πρεσβυτέρα ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀναστῆναι.<br/>So they made their father drink wine in that night, and the elder went in and lay with her father that night, and he knew not when he slept and when he rose up.<br/><br/>
34. ἐγένετο δὲ τῇ ἐπαύριον καὶ εἶπεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα πρὸς τὴν νεωτέραν Ἰδοὺ ἐκοιμήθην ἐχθὲς μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν· ποτίσωμεν αὐτὸν οἶνον καὶ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην, καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα κοιμήθητι μετ' αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξαναστήσωμεν ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σπέρμα.<br/>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the elder said to the younger, Behold, I slept last night with our father, let us make him drink wine in this night also, and you go in and sleep with him, and let us raise up seed of our father.<br/><br/>
35. ἐπότισαν δὲ καὶ ἐν τῇ νυκτὶ ἐκείνῃ τὸν πατέρα αὐτῶν οἶνον, καὶ εἰσελθοῦσα ἡ νεωτέρα ἐκοιμήθη μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῆς, καὶ οὐκ ᾔδει ἐν τῷ κοιμηθῆναι αὐτὴν καὶ ἀναστῆναι.<br/>So they made their father drink wine in that night also, and the younger went in and slept with her father, and he knew not when he slept, nor when he arose.<br/><br/>
36. καὶ συνέλαβον αἱ δύο θυγατέρες Λωτ ἐκ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν.<br/>And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.<br/><br/>
37. καὶ ἔτεκεν ἡ πρεσβυτέρα υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Μωαβ λέγουσα Ἑκ τοῦ πατρός μου· οὗτος πατὴρ Μωαβιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.<br/>And the elder bore a son and called his name Moab, saying, [He is] of my father. This is the father of the Moabites to this present day.<br/><br/>
38. ἔτεκεν δὲ καὶ ἡ νεωτέρα υἱὸν καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Αμμαν υἱὸς τοῦ γένους μου· οὗτος πατὴρ Αμμανιτῶν ἕως τῆς σήμερον ἡμέρας.<br/>And the younger also bore a son, and called his name Amman, saying, The son of my family. This is the father of the Ammanites to this present day.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>## 20<br/><br/>
1. Καὶ ἐκίνησεν ἐκεῖθεν Αβρααμ εἰς γῆν πρὸς λίβα καὶ ᾤκησεν ἀνὰ μέσον Καδης καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Σουρ καὶ παρῴκησεν ἐν Γεραροις.<br/>And Abraam removed thence to the southern country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara.<br/><br/>
2. εἶπεν δὲ Αβρααμ περὶ Σαρρας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ ὅτι Ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ εἰπεῖν ὅτι Γυνή μού ἐστιν, μήποτε ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τῆς πόλεως δι' αὐτήν. ἀπέστειλεν δὲ Αβιμελεχ βασιλεὺς Γεραρων καὶ ἔλαβεν τὴν Σαρραν.<br/>And Abraam said concerning Sarrha his wife, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the city should kill him for her sake. So Abimelech king of Gerara sent and took Sarrha.<br/><br/>
3. καὶ εἰσῆλθεν ὁ θεὸς πρὸς Αβιμελεχ ἐν ὕπνῳ τὴν νύκτα καὶ εἶπεν Ἰδοὺ σὺ ἀποθνῄσκεις περὶ τῆς γυναικός, ἧς ἔλαβες, αὕτη δέ ἐστιν συνῳκηκυῖα ἀνδρί.<br/>And God came to Abimelech by night in sleep, and said, Behold, you die for the woman, whom you have taken, whereas she has lived with a husband.<br/><br/>
4. Αβιμελεχ δὲ οὐχ ἥψατο αὐτῆς καὶ εἶπεν Κύριε, ἔθνος ἀγνοοῦν καὶ δίκαιον ἀπολεῖς;<br/>But Abimelech had not touched her, and he said, Lord, will you destroy an ignorantly [sinning] and just nation?
5. οὐκ αὐτός μοι εἶπεν Ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν; καὶ αὐτή μοι εἶπεν Ἀδελφός μού ἐστιν. ἐν καθαρᾷ καρδίᾳ καὶ ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ χειρῶν ἐποίησα τοῦτο.<br/>Said he not to me, She is my sister, and said she not to me, He is my brother? with a pure heart and in the righteousness of my hands have I done this.<br/><br/>
6. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς καθ' ὕπνον Κἀγὼ ἔγνων ὅτι ἐν καθαρᾷ καρδίᾳ ἐποίησας τοῦτο, καὶ ἐφεισάμην ἐγώ σου τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτεῖν σε εἰς ἐμέ· ἕνεκεν τούτου οὐκ ἀφῆκά σε ἅψασθαι αὐτῆς.<br/>And God said to him in sleep, Yes, I knew that you did this with a pure heart, and I spared you, so that you should not sin against me, therefore I suffered you not to touch her.<br/><br/>
7. νῦν δὲ ἀπόδος τὴν γυναῖκα τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ, ὅτι προφήτης ἐστὶν καὶ προσεύξεται περὶ σοῦ καὶ ζήσῃ· εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀποδίδως, γνῶθι ὅτι ἀποθανῇ σὺ καὶ πάντα τὰ σά.<br/>But now return the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and shall pray for you, and you shall live; but if you restore her not, know that you shall die and all thine.<br/><br/>
8. καὶ ὤρθρισεν Αβιμελεχ τὸ πρωῒ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν πάντας τοὺς παῖδας αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐλάλησεν πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα εἰς τὰ ὦτα αὐτῶν, ἐφοβήθησαν δὲ πάντες οἱ ἄνθρωποι σφόδρα.<br/>And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and he spoke all these words in their ears, and all the men feared exceedingly.<br/><br/>
9. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Αβιμελεχ τὸν Αβρααμ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Τί τοῦτο ἐποίησας ἡμῖν; μή τι ἡμάρτομεν εἰς σέ, ὅτι ἐπήγαγες ἐπ' ἐμὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλείαν μου ἁμαρτίαν μεγάλην; ἔργον, ὃ οὐδεὶς ποιήσει, πεποίηκάς μοι.<br/>And Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, What is this that you have done to us? Have we sinned against you, that you have brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me a deed, which no one ought to do.<br/><br/>
10. εἶπεν δὲ Αβιμελεχ τῷ Αβρααμ Τί ἐνιδὼν ἐποίησας τοῦτο;<br/>And Abimelech said to Abraam, What have you seen in [me] that you have done this?
11. εἶπεν δὲ Αβρααμ Εἶπα γάρ Ἄρα οὐκ ἔστιν θεοσέβεια ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ, ἐμέ τε ἀποκτενοῦσιν ἕνεκεν τῆς γυναικός μου.<br/>And Abraam said, Why I said, Surely there is not the worship of God in this place, and they will slay me because of my wife.<br/><br/>
12. καὶ γὰρ ἀληθῶς ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν ἐκ πατρός, ἀλλ' οὐκ ἐκ μητρός· ἐγενήθη δέ μοι εἰς γυναῖκα.<br/>For truly she is my sister by my father, but not by my mother, and she became my wife.<br/><br/>
13. ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἐξήγαγέν με ὁ θεὸς ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ πατρός μου, καὶ εἶπα αὐτῇ Ταύτην τὴν δικαιοσύνην ποιήσεις ἐπ' ἐμέ· εἰς πάντα τόπον, οὗ ἐὰν εἰσέλθωμεν ἐκεῖ, εἰπὸν ἐμὲ ὅτι Ἀδελφός μού ἐστιν.<br/>And it came to pass when God brought me forth out of the house of my father, that I said to her, This righteousness you shall perform to me, in every place into which we may enter, say of me, He is my brother.<br/><br/>

16. τῇ δὲ Σαρρα εἶπεν Ἰδοὺ δέδωκα χίλια δίδραχμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου· ταῦτα ἔσται σοι εἰς τιμὴν τοῦ προσώπου σου καὶ πάσαις ταῖς μετὰ σοῦ· καὶ πάντα ἀλήθευσον.<br/>And to Sarrha he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, those shall be to you for the price of your countenance, and to all the women with you, and speak the truth in all things.<br/><br/>
17. προσηύξατο δὲ Αβρααμ πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ ἰάσατο ὁ θεὸς τὸν Αβιμελεχ καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς παιδίσκας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔτεκον·<br/>And Abraam prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his women servants, and they bore children.<br/><br/>

16. ἀπελθοῦσα δὲ ἐκάθητο ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ μακρόθεν ὡσεὶ τόξου βολήν· εἶπεν γάρ Οὐ μὴ ἴδω τὸν θάνατον τοῦ παιδίου μου. καὶ ἐκάθισεν ἀπέναντι αὐτοῦ, ἀναβοῆσαν δὲ τὸ παιδίον ἔκλαυσεν.<br/>And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bow-shot, for she said, Surely I cannot see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.<br/><br/>
17. εἰσήκουσεν δὲ ὁ θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, οὗ ἦν, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἄγγελος τοῦ θεοῦ τὴν Αγαρ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῇ Τί ἐστιν, Αγαρ; μὴ φοβοῦ· ἐπακήκοεν γὰρ ὁ θεὸς τῆς φωνῆς τοῦ παιδίου σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου, οὗ ἐστιν.<br/>And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Agar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Agar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.<br/><br/>

7. Ἑπηρώτησαν δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου περὶ Ρεβεκκας τῆς γυναικὸς αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν Ἀδελφή μού ἐστιν· ἐφοβήθη γὰρ εἰπεῖν ὅτι Γυνή μού ἐστιν, μήποτε ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτὸν οἱ ἄνδρες τοῦ τόπου περὶ Ρεβεκκας, ὅτι ὡραία τῇ ὄψει ἦν.<br/>And the men of the place questioned him concerning Rebecca his wife, and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest at any time the men of the place should slay him because of Rebecca, because she was fair.<br/><br/>

36. καὶ εἶπεν Δικαίως ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ιακωβ· ἐπτέρνικεν γάρ με ἤδη δεύτερον τοῦτο· τά τε πρωτοτόκιά μου εἴληφεν καὶ νῦν εἴληφεν τὴν εὐλογίαν μου. καὶ εἶπεν Ησαυ τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ Οὐχ ὑπελίπω μοι εὐλογίαν, πάτερ;<br/>And he said, Rightly was his name called Jacob, for lo! this second time has he supplanted me; he has both taken my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing; and Esau said to his father, Have you not left a blessing for me, father?
37. ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ισαακ εἶπεν τῷ Ησαυ Εἰ κύριον αὐτὸν ἐποίησά σου καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐποίησα αὐτοῦ οἰκέτας, σίτῳ καὶ οἴνῳ ἐστήρισα αὐτόν, σοὶ δὲ τί ποιήσω, τέκνον;<br/>And Isaac answered and said to Esau, If I have made him your lord, and have made all his brethren his servants, and have strengthened him with corn and wine, what then shall I do for you, son?
38. εἶπεν δὲ Ησαυ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ Μὴ εὐλογία μία σοί ἐστιν, πάτερ; εὐλόγησον δὴ κἀμέ, πάτερ. κατανυχθέντος δὲ Ισαακ ἀνεβόησεν φωνὴν Ησαυ καὶ ἔκλαυσεν.<br/>And Esau said to his father, Have you [only] one blessing, father? Bless, I pray you, me also, father. And Isaac being troubled, Esau cried aloud and wept.<br/><br/>
39. ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ισαακ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτῷ
Ἰδοὺ ἀπὸ τῆς πιότητος τῆς γῆς ἔσται ἡ κατοίκησίς σου
καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς δρόσου τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἄνωθεν·
And Isaac his father answered and said to him,
Behold, your dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth,
and of the dew of heaven from above.<br/><br/>
40. καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ μαχαίρῃ σου ζήσῃ
καὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου δουλεύσεις·
ἔσται δὲ ἡνίκα ἐὰν καθέλῃς,
καὶ ἐκλύσεις τὸν ζυγὸν αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ τραχήλου σου.<br/>And you shall live by your sword,
and shall serve your brother;

Ἑπορεύθη δὲ Ρουβην ἐν ἡμέραις θερισμοῦ πυρῶν καὶ εὗρεν μῆλα μανδραγόρου ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ καὶ ἤνεγκεν αὐτὰ πρὸς Λειαν τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ. εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ τῇ Λεια Δός μοι τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου.<br/>And Ruben went in the day of barley-harvest, and found apples of mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Lea; and Rachel said to Lea her sister, Give me of your son's mandrakes.<br/><br/>
15. εἶπεν δὲ Λεια Οὐχ ἱκανόν σοι ὅτι ἔλαβες τὸν ἄνδρα μου; μὴ καὶ τοὺς μανδραγόρας τοῦ υἱοῦ μου λήμψῃ; εἶπεν δὲ Ραχηλ Οὐχ οὕτως· κοιμηθήτω μετὰ σοῦ τὴν νύκτα ταύτην ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ σου.<br/>And Lea said, [Is it] not enough for you that you have taken my husband, will you also take my son's mandrakes? And Rachel said, Not so: let him lie with you to-night for your son's mandrakes.<br/><br/>
16. εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἐξ ἀγροῦ ἑσπέρας, καὶ ἐξῆλθεν Λεια εἰς συνάντησιν αὐτῷ καὶ εἶπεν Πρός με εἰσελεύσῃ σήμερον· μεμίσθωμαι γάρ σε ἀντὶ τῶν μανδραγορῶν τοῦ υἱοῦ μου. καὶ ἐκοιμήθη μετ' αὐτῆς τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην.<br/>And Jacob came in out of the field at even; and Lea went forth to meet him, and said, You shall come in to me this day, for I have hired you for my son's mandrakes; and he lay with her that night.<br/><br/>

30. μικρὰ γὰρ ἦν ὅσα σοι ἦν ἐναντίον ἐμοῦ, καὶ ηὐξήθη εἰς πλῆθος, καὶ ηὐλόγησέν σε κύριος ἐπὶ τῷ ποδί μου. νῦν οὖν πότε ποιήσω κἀγὼ ἐμαυτῷ οἶκον;<br/>For it was little you had before my time, and it is increased to a multitude, and the Lord God has blessed you since my coming; now then, when shall I set up also my own house?
31. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν Τί σοι δώσω; εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ιακωβ Οὐ δώσεις μοι οὐθέν· ἐὰν ποιήσῃς μοι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο, πάλιν ποιμανῶ τὰ πρόβατά σου καὶ φυλάξω.<br/>And Laban said to him, What shall I give you? and Jacob said to him, You shall not give me anything; if you will do this thing for me, I will again tend your flocks and keep them.<br/><br/>
32. παρελθάτω πάντα τὰ πρόβατά σου σήμερον, καὶ διαχώρισον ἐκεῖθεν πᾶν πρόβατον φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀρνάσιν καὶ πᾶν διάλευκον καὶ ῥαντὸν ἐν ταῖς αἰξίν· ἔσται μοι μισθός.<br/>Let all your sheep pass by to-day, and separate thence every grey sheep among the rams, and every one that is speckled and spotted among the goats-- [this] shall be my reward.<br/><br/>

34. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Λαβαν Ἔστω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου.<br/>And Laban said to him, Let it be according to your word.<br/><br/>
35. καὶ διέστειλεν ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ τοὺς τράγους τοὺς ῥαντοὺς καὶ τοὺς διαλεύκους καὶ πάσας τὰς αἶγας τὰς ῥαντὰς καὶ τὰς διαλεύκους καὶ πᾶν, ὃ ἦν λευκὸν ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ πᾶν, ὃ ἦν φαιὸν ἐν τοῖς ἀρνάσιν, καὶ ἔδωκεν διὰ χειρὸς τῶν υἱῶν αὐτοῦ.<br/>And he separated in that day the spotted and speckled he-goats, and all the spotted and speckled she-goats, and all that was grey among the rams, and every one that was white among them, and he gave them into the hand of his sons.<br/><br/>
36. καὶ ἀπέστησεν ὁδὸν τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἀνὰ μέσον αὐτῶν καὶ ἀνὰ μέσον Ιακωβ· Ιακωβ δὲ ἐποίμαινεν τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν τὰ ὑπολειφθέντα. -<br/>And he set a distance of a three days' journey between them and Jacob. And Jacob tended the cattle of Laban that were left behind.<br/><br/>
37. ἔλαβεν δὲ ἑαυτῷ Ιακωβ ῥάβδον στυρακίνην χλωρὰν καὶ καρυίνην καὶ πλατάνου, καὶ ἐλέπισεν αὐτὰς Ιακωβ λεπίσματα λευκὰ περισύρων τὸ χλωρόν· ἐφαίνετο δὲ ἐπὶ ταῖς ῥάβδοις τὸ λευκόν, ὃ ἐλέπισεν, ποικίλον.<br/>And Jacob took to himself green rods of storax tree and walnut and plane-tree; and Jacob peeled in them white stripes; and as he drew off the green, the white stripe which he had made appeared alternate on the rods.<br/><br/>
38. καὶ παρέθηκεν τὰς ῥάβδους, ἃς ἐλέπισεν, ἐν ταῖς ληνοῖς τῶν ποτιστηρίων τοῦ ὕδατος, ἵνα, ὡς ἂν ἔλθωσιν τὰ πρόβατα πιεῖν ἐνώπιον τῶν ῥάβδων, ἐλθόντων αὐτῶν εἰς τὸ πιεῖν,<br/>And he laid the rods which he had peeled, in the hollows of the watering-troughs, that whenever the cattle should come to drink, as they should have come to drink before the rods, the cattle might conceive at the rods.<br/><br/>

40. τοὺς δὲ ἀμνοὺς διέστειλεν Ιακωβ καὶ ἔστησεν ἐναντίον τῶν προβάτων κριὸν διάλευκον καὶ πᾶν ποικίλον ἐν τοῖς ἀμνοῖς· καὶ διεχώρισεν ἑαυτῷ ποίμνια καθ' ἑαυτὸν καὶ οὐκ ἔμιξεν αὐτὰ εἰς τὰ πρόβατα Λαβαν.<br/>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set before the sheep a speckled ram, and every variegated one among the lambs, and he separated flocks for himself alone, and did not mingle them with the sheep of Laban.<br/><br/>
41. ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ καιρῷ, ᾧ ἐνεκίσσησεν τὰ πρόβατα ἐν γαστρὶ λαμβάνοντα, ἔθηκεν Ιακωβ τὰς ῥάβδους ἐναντίον τῶν προβάτων ἐν ταῖς ληνοῖς τοῦ ἐγκισσῆσαι αὐτὰ κατὰ τὰς ῥάβδους·<br/>And it came to pass in the time when the cattle became pregnant, conceiving in the belly, Jacob put the rods before the cattle in the troughs, that they might conceive by the rods.<br/><br/>
42. ἡνίκα δ' ἂν ἔτεκον τὰ πρόβατα, οὐκ ἐτίθει· ἐγένετο δὲ τὰ ἄσημα τοῦ Λαβαν, τὰ δὲ ἐπίσημα τοῦ Ιακωβ.<br/>But he did not put them in [indiscriminately] whenever the cattle happened to bring forth, but the unmarked ones were Laban's, and the marked ones were Jacob's.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>## 31<br/><br/>
1. Ἤκουσεν δὲ Ιακωβ τὰ ῥήματα τῶν υἱῶν Λαβαν λεγόντων Εἴληφεν Ιακωβ πάντα τὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ ἐκ τῶν τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν πεποίηκεν πᾶσαν τὴν δόξαν ταύτην.<br/>And Jacob heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken all that was our father's, and of our father's property has he gotten all this glory.<br/><br/>

5. καὶ εἶπεν αὐταῖς Ὁρῶ ἐγὼ τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν πρὸς ἐμοῦ ὡς ἐχθὲς καὶ τρίτην ἡμέραν· ὁ δὲ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου ἦν μετ' ἐμοῦ.<br/>And he said to them, I see the face of your father, that it is not toward me as before, but the God of my father was with me.<br/><br/>
6. καὶ αὐταὶ δὲ οἴδατε ὅτι ἐν πάσῃ τῇ ἰσχύι μου δεδούλευκα τῷ πατρὶ ὑμῶν.<br/>And you too know that with all my might I have served your father.<br/><br/>
7. ὁ δὲ πατὴρ ὑμῶν παρεκρούσατό με καὶ ἤλλαξεν τὸν μισθόν μου τῶν δέκα ἀμνῶν, καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ ὁ θεὸς κακοποιῆσαί με.<br/>But your father deceived me, and changed my wages for the ten lambs, yet God gave him not [power] to hurt me.<br/><br/>
8. ἐὰν οὕτως εἴπῃ Τὰ ποικίλα ἔσται σου μισθός, καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα ποικίλα· ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ Τὰ λευκὰ ἔσται σου μισθός, καὶ τέξεται πάντα τὰ πρόβατα λευκά·<br/>If he should say thus, The speckled shall be your reward, then all the cattle would bear speckled; and if he should say, The white shall be your reward, then would all the cattle bear white.<br/><br/>
9. καὶ ἀφείλατο ὁ θεὸς πάντα τὰ κτήνη τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ἔδωκέν μοι αὐτά.<br/>So God has taken away all the cattle of your father, and given them to me.<br/><br/>
10. καὶ ἐγένετο ἡνίκα ἐνεκίσσων τὰ πρόβατα, καὶ εἶδον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτὰ ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ, καὶ ἰδοὺ οἱ τράγοι καὶ οἱ κριοὶ ἀναβαίνοντες ἦσαν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διάλευκοι καὶ ποικίλοι καὶ σποδοειδεῖς ῥαντοί.<br/>And it came to pass when the cattle conceived and were with young, that I beheld with mine eyes in sleep, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-coloured spots.<br/><br/>

12. καὶ εἶπεν Ἀνάβλεψον τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς σου καὶ ἰδὲ τοὺς τράγους καὶ τοὺς κριοὺς ἀναβαίνοντας ἐπὶ τὰ πρόβατα καὶ τὰς αἶγας διαλεύκους καὶ ποικίλους καὶ σποδοειδεῖς ῥαντούς· ἑώρακα γὰρ ὅσα σοι Λαβαν ποιεῖ.<br/>And he said, Look up with your eyes, and behold the he-goats and the rams leaping on the sheep and the she-goats, speckled and variegated and spotted with ash-coloured spots; for I have seen all things that Laban does to you.<br/><br/>
13. ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ θεὸς ὁ ὀφθείς σοι ἐν τόπῳ θεοῦ, οὗ ἤλειψάς μοι ἐκεῖ στήλην καὶ ηὔξω μοι ἐκεῖ εὐχήν· νῦν οὖν ἀνάστηθι καὶ ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς ταύτης καὶ ἄπελθε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς γενέσεώς σου, καὶ ἔσομαι μετὰ σοῦ.<br/>I am God that appeared to you in the place of God where you anointed a pillar to me, and vowed to me there a vow; now then arise and depart out of this land, depart into the land of your nativity, and I will be with you.<br/><br/>

16. πάντα τὸν πλοῦτον καὶ τὴν δόξαν, ἣν ἀφείλατο ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, ἡμῖν ἔσται καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν. νῦν οὖν ὅσα εἴρηκέν σοι ὁ θεός, ποίει.<br/>All the wealth and the glory which God has taken from our father, it shall be our's and our children's; now then do whatsoever God has said to you.<br/><br/>

18. καὶ ἀπήγαγεν πάντα τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν ἀποσκευὴν αὐτοῦ, ἣν περιεποιήσατο ἐν τῇ Μεσοποταμίᾳ, καὶ πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ ἀπελθεῖν πρὸς Ισαακ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Χανααν.<br/>and he took away all his possessions and all his store, which he had gotten in Mesopotamia, and all that belonged to him, to depart to Isaac his father in the land of Chanaan.<br/><br/>

25. καὶ κατέλαβεν Λαβαν τὸν Ιακωβ· Ιακωβ δὲ ἔπηξεν τὴν σκηνὴν αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει· Λαβαν δὲ ἔστησεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ ὄρει Γαλααδ.<br/>And Laban overtook Jacob; and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban stationed his brothers in the mount Galaad.<br/><br/>
26. εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Ιακωβ Τί ἐποίησας; ἵνα τί κρυφῇ ἀπέδρας καὶ ἐκλοποφόρησάς με καὶ ἀπήγαγες τὰς θυγατέρας μου ὡς αἰχμαλώτιδας μαχαίρᾳ;<br/>And Laban said to Jacob, What have you done? why did you run away secretly, and pillage me, and lead away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
27. καὶ εἰ ἀνήγγειλάς μοι, ἐξαπέστειλα ἄν σε μετ' εὐφροσύνης καὶ μετὰ μουσικῶν, τυμπάνων καὶ κιθάρας.<br/>Whereas if you had told me, I would have sent you away with mirth, and with songs, and timbrels, and harp.<br/><br/>
28. οὐκ ἠξιώθην καταφιλῆσαι τὰ παιδία μου καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας μου. νῦν δὲ ἀφρόνως ἔπραξας.<br/>And I was not counted worthy to embrace my children and my daughters; now then you have wrought foolishly.<br/><br/>

32. ἐπίγνωθι, τί ἐστιν τῶν σῶν παρ' ἐμοί, καὶ λαβέ. καὶ οὐκ ἐπέγνω παρ' αὐτῷ οὐθέν. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ιακωβ Παρ ᾧ ἐὰν εὕρῃς τοὺς θεούς σου, οὐ ζήσεται ἐναντίον τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἡμῶν. οὐκ ᾔδει δὲ Ιακωβ ὅτι Ραχηλ ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ ἔκλεψεν αὐτούς.<br/>And Jacob said, With whomsoever you shall find your gods, he shall not live in the presence of our brethren; take notice of what I have of your property, and take it; and he observed nothing with him, but Jacob knew not that his wife Rachel had stolen them.<br/><br/>

38. ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι μετὰ σοῦ· τὰ πρόβατά σου καὶ αἱ αἶγές σου οὐκ ἠτεκνώθησαν· κριοὺς τῶν προβάτων σου οὐ κατέφαγον·<br/>These twenty years have I been with you; your sheep, and your she-goats have not failed in bearing; I devoured not the rams of your cattle.<br/><br/>
39. θηριάλωτον οὐκ ἀνενήνοχά σοι, ἐγὼ ἀπετίννυον παρ' ἐμαυτοῦ κλέμματα ἡμέρας καὶ κλέμματα νυκτός·<br/>That which was taken of beasts I brought not to you; I made good of myself the thefts of the day, and the thefts of the night.<br/><br/>
40. ἐγινόμην τῆς ἡμέρας συγκαιόμενος τῷ καύματι καὶ παγετῷ τῆς νυκτός, καὶ ἀφίστατο ὁ ὕπνος ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν μου.<br/>I was parched with heat by day, and [chilled] with frost by night, and my sleep departed from my eyes.<br/><br/>
41. ταῦτά μοι εἴκοσι ἔτη ἐγώ εἰμι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ σου· ἐδούλευσά σοι δέκα τέσσαρα ἔτη ἀντὶ τῶν δύο θυγατέρων σου καὶ ἓξ ἔτη ἐν τοῖς προβάτοις σου, καὶ παρελογίσω τὸν μισθόν μου δέκα ἀμνάσιν.<br/>These twenty years have I been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years among your sheep, and you falsely rated my wages for ten lambs.<br/><br/>
42. εἰ μὴ ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Αβρααμ καὶ ὁ φόβος Ισαακ ἦν μοι, νῦν ἂν κενόν με ἐξαπέστειλας· τὴν ταπείνωσίν μου καὶ τὸν κόπον τῶν χειρῶν μου εἶδεν ὁ θεὸς καὶ ἤλεγξέν σε ἐχθές.<br/>Unless I had the God of my father Abraam, and the fear of Isaac, now you would have sent me away empty; God saw my humiliation, and the labour of my hands, and rebuked you yesterday.<br/><br/>
43. ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Λαβαν εἶπεν τῷ Ιακωβ Αἱ θυγατέρες θυγατέρες μου, καὶ οἱ υἱοὶ υἱοί μου, καὶ τὰ κτήνη κτήνη μου, καὶ πάντα, ὅσα σὺ ὁρᾷς, ἐμά ἐστιν καὶ τῶν θυγατέρων μου. τί ποιήσω ταύταις σήμερον ἢ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῶν, οἷς ἔτεκον;<br/>And Laban answered and said to Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons my sons, and the cattle are my cattle, and all things which you see are mine, and [the property] of my daughters; what shall I do to them to-day, or their children which they bore?
44. νῦν οὖν δεῦρο διαθώμεθα διαθήκην ἐγὼ καὶ σύ, καὶ ἔσται εἰς μαρτύριον ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ἰδοὺ οὐθεὶς μεθ' ἡμῶν ἐστιν, ἰδὲ ὁ θεὸς μάρτυς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ.<br/>Now then come, let me make a covenant, both I and you, and it shall be for a witness between me and you; and he said to him, Behold, there is no one with us; behold, God is witness between me and you.<br/><br/>
45. λαβὼν δὲ Ιακωβ λίθον ἔστησεν αὐτὸν στήλην.<br/>And Jacob having taken a stone, set it up for a pillar.<br/><br/>
46. εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ Συλλέγετε λίθους. καὶ συνέλεξαν λίθους καὶ ἐποίησαν βουνόν, καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον ἐκεῖ ἐπὶ τοῦ βουνοῦ.<br/>And Jacob said to his brethren, Gather stones; and they gathered stones and made a heap, and ate there upon the heap;
καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Λαβαν Ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος μαρτυρεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ σήμερον.<br/>and Laban said to him, This heap witnesses between me and you to-day.<br/><br/>
47. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Λαβαν Βουνὸς τῆς μαρτυρίας, Ιακωβ δὲ ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸν Βουνὸς μάρτυς.<br/>And Laban called it the Heap of Testimony; and Jacob called it the Witness Heap.<br/><br/>
48. εἶπεν δὲ Λαβαν τῷ Ιακωβ Ἰδοὺ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ ἡ στήλη αὕτη, ἣν ἔστησα ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ,<br/>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold, this heap, and this pillar are a witness.<br/><br/>
48. μαρτυρεῖ ὁ βουνὸς οὗτος καὶ μαρτυρεῖ ἡ στήλη αὕτη·<br/>For if I should not cross over to you, neither should you cross over to me, for mischief beyond this heap and this pillar.<br/><br/>
48. διὰ τοῦτο ἐκλήθη τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Βουνὸς μαρτυρεῖ<br/>And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and the pillar, which I have set between me and thee; this heap witnesses, and this pillar witnesses; therefore its name was called, the Heap witnesses.<br/><br/>
49. καὶ Ἡ ὅρασις, ἣν εἶπεν Ἑπίδοι ὁ θεὸς ἀνὰ μέσον ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ, ὅτι ἀποστησόμεθα ἕτερος ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑτέρου.<br/>And the vision of which he said-- Let God look to it between me and you, because we are about to depart from each other,-
50. εἰ ταπεινώσεις τὰς θυγατέρας μου, εἰ λήμψῃ γυναῖκας ἐπὶ ταῖς θυγατράσιν μου, ὅρα οὐθεὶς μεθ' ἡμῶν ἐστιν·<br/>If you shall humble my daughters, if you should take wives in addition to my daughters, see, there is no one with us looking on. God [is] witness between me and you.<br/><br/>
52. ἐάν τε γὰρ ἐγὼ μὴ διαβῶ πρὸς σὲ μηδὲ σὺ διαβῇς πρός με τὸν βουνὸν τοῦτον καὶ τὴν στήλην ταύτην ἐπὶ κακίᾳ,<br/>
53. ὁ θεὸς Αβρααμ καὶ ὁ θεὸς Ναχωρ κρινεῖ ἀνὰ μέσον ἡμῶν. καὶ ὤμοσεν Ιακωβ κατὰ τοῦ φόβου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ισαακ.<br/>The God of Abraam and the God of Nachor judge between us; and Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac.<br/><br/>
54. καὶ ἔθυσεν Ιακωβ θυσίαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔφαγον καὶ ἔπιον καὶ ἐκοιμήθησαν ἐν τῷ ὄρει.<br/>And he offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren, and they ate and drank, and slept in the mountain.<br/><br/>
55. ἀναστὰς δὲ Λαβαν τὸ πρωῒ κατεφίλησεν τοὺς υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰς θυγατέρας αὐτοῦ καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς, καὶ ἀποστραφεὶς Λαβαν ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν τόπον αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Jacob departed for his journey; and having looked up, he saw the host of God encamped; and the angels of God met him.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>## 32<br/><br/>
1. Καὶ Ιακωβ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ὁδόν. καὶ ἀναβλέψας εἶδεν παρεμβολὴν θεοῦ παρεμβεβληκυῖαν, καὶ συνήντησαν αὐτῷ οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ.<br/>And Jacob said, when he saw them, This is the Camp of God; and he called the name of that place, Encampments.<br/><br/>
2. εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ, ἡνίκα εἶδεν αὐτούς Παρεμβολὴ θεοῦ αὕτη· καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Παρεμβολαί.<br/>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, to the country of Edom.<br/><br/>
3. Ἀπέστειλεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἀγγέλους ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πρὸς Ησαυ τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ εἰς γῆν Σηιρ εἰς χώραν Εδωμ<br/>And he charged them, saying, Thus shall you say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob; I have sojourned with Laban and tarried until now.<br/><br/>
4. καὶ ἐνετείλατο αὐτοῖς λέγων Οὕτως ἐρεῖτε τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ησαυ Οὕτως λέγει ὁ παῖς σου Ιακωβ Μετὰ Λαβαν παρῴκησα καὶ ἐχρόνισα ἕως τοῦ νῦν,<br/>And there were born to me oxen, and asses, and sheep, and men-servants and women-servants; and I sent to tell my lord Esau, that your servant might find grace in your sight.<br/><br/>
5. καὶ ἐγένοντό μοι βόες καὶ ὄνοι καὶ πρόβατα καὶ παῖδες καὶ παιδίσκαι, καὶ ἀπέστειλα ἀναγγεῖλαι τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ησαυ, ἵνα εὕρῃ ὁ παῖς σου χάριν ἐναντίον σου.<br/>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to your brother Esau, and lo! he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him.<br/><br/>
6. καὶ ἀνέστρεψαν οἱ ἄγγελοι πρὸς Ιακωβ λέγοντες Ἤλθομεν πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφόν σου Ησαυ, καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ἔρχεται εἰς συνάντησίν σοι καὶ τετρακόσιοι ἄνδρες μετ' αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Jacob was greatly terrified, and was perplexed; and he divided the people that was with him, and the cows, and the camels, and the sheep, into two camps.<br/><br/>
7. ἐφοβήθη δὲ Ιακωβ σφόδρα καὶ ἠπορεῖτο. καὶ διεῖλεν τὸν λαὸν τὸν μετ' αὐτοῦ καὶ τοὺς βόας καὶ τὰ πρόβατα εἰς δύο παρεμβολάς,<br/>And Jacob said, If Esau should come to one camp, and smite it, the other camp shall be in safety.<br/><br/>
8. καὶ εἶπεν Ιακωβ Ἑὰν ἔλθῃ Ησαυ εἰς παρεμβολὴν μίαν καὶ ἐκκόψῃ αὐτήν, ἔσται ἡ παρεμβολὴ ἡ δευτέρα εἰς τὸ σῴζεσθαι.<br/>And Jacob said, God of my father Abraam, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you [are] he that said to me, Depart quickly to the land of your birth, and I will do you good.<br/><br/>
9. εἶπεν δὲ Ιακωβ Ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Αβρααμ καὶ ὁ θεὸς τοῦ πατρός μου Ισαακ, κύριε ὁ εἴπας μοι Ἀπότρεχε εἰς τὴν γῆν τῆς γενέσεώς σου καὶ εὖ σε ποιήσω,<br/>Let there be to me a sufficiency of all the justice and all the truth which you have wrought with your servant; for with this my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two camps.<br/><br/>
10. ἱκανοῦταί μοι ἀπὸ πάσης δικαιοσύνης καὶ ἀπὸ πάσης ἀληθείας, ἧς ἐποίησας τῷ παιδί σου· ἐν γὰρ τῇ ῥάβδῳ μου διέβην τὸν Ιορδάνην τοῦτον, νῦν δὲ γέγονα εἰς δύο παρεμβολάς.<br/>Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and smite me, and the mother upon the children.<br/><br/>
11. ἐξελοῦ με ἐκ χειρὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ μου Ησαυ, ὅτι φοβοῦμαι ἐγὼ αὐτόν, μήποτε ἐλθὼν πατάξῃ με καὶ μητέρα ἐπὶ τέκνοις.<br/>But you said, I will do you good, and will make your seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.<br/><br/>
12. σὺ δὲ εἶπας Καλῶς εὖ σε ποιήσω καὶ θήσω τὸ σπέρμα σου ὡς τὴν ἄμμον τῆς θαλάσσης, ἣ οὐκ ἀριθμηθήσεται ἀπὸ τοῦ πλήθους.<br/>And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried [with him], and sent out to Esau his brother,
13. καὶ ἐκοιμήθη ἐκεῖ τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην. καὶ ἔλαβεν ὧν ἔφερεν δῶρα καὶ ἐξαπέστειλεν Ησαυ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ,<br/>two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,
14. αἶγας διακοσίας, τράγους εἴκοσι, πρόβατα διακόσια, κριοὺς εἴκοσι,<br/>milch camels, and their foals, thirty, forty kine, ten bulls, twenty asses, and ten colts.<br/><br/>

16. καὶ ἔδωκεν διὰ χειρὸς τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ ποίμνιον κατὰ μόνας. εἶπεν δὲ τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ Προπορεύεσθε ἔμπροσθέν μου καὶ διάστημα ποιεῖτε ἀνὰ μέσον ποίμνης καὶ ποίμνης.<br/>And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meets you, and he asks you, saying, Whose are you? and where would you go, and whose are these possessions advancing before you?
17. καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ πρώτῳ λέγων Ἑάν σοι συναντήσῃ Ησαυ ὁ ἀδελφός μου καὶ ἐρωτᾷ σε λέγων Τίνος εἶ καὶ ποῦ πορεύῃ, καὶ τίνος ταῦτα τὰ προπορευόμενά σου;<br/>You shall say, Your servant Jacob's; he hath sent gifts to my lord Esau, and lo! he is behind us.<br/><br/>
18. ἐρεῖς Τοῦ παιδός σου Ιακωβ· δῶρα ἀπέσταλκεν τῷ κυρίῳ μου Ησαυ, καὶ ἰδοὺ αὐτὸς ὀπίσω ἡμῶν.<br/>And he charged the first and the second and the third, and all that went before him after these flocks, saying, Thus shall you speak to Esau when you find him;
19. καὶ ἐνετείλατο τῷ πρώτῳ καὶ τῷ δευτέρῳ καὶ τῷ τρίτῳ καὶ πᾶσι τοῖς προπορευομένοις ὀπίσω τῶν ποιμνίων τούτων λέγων Κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο λαλήσατε Ησαυ ἐν τῷ εὑρεῖν ὑμᾶς αὐτὸν<br/>and you shall say, Behold your servant Jacob comes after us. For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going before his presence, and afterwards I will behold his face, for perhaps, he will accept me.<br/><br/>
20. καὶ ἐρεῖτε Ἰδοὺ ὁ παῖς σου Ιακωβ παραγίνεται ὀπίσω ἡμῶν. εἶπεν γάρ Ἑξιλάσομαι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἐν τοῖς δώροις τοῖς προπορευομένοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ μετὰ τοῦτο ὄψομαι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ· ἴσως γὰρ προσδέξεται τὸ πρόσωπόν μου.<br/>So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.<br/><br/>
21. καὶ παρεπορεύοντο τὰ δῶρα κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, αὐτὸς δὲ ἐκοιμήθη τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην ἐν τῇ παρεμβολῇ.<br/>And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two servant-maids, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jaboch.<br/><br/>
22. Ἀναστὰς δὲ τὴν νύκτα ἐκείνην ἔλαβεν τὰς δύο γυναῖκας καὶ τὰς δύο παιδίσκας καὶ τὰ ἕνδεκα παιδία αὐτοῦ καὶ διέβη τὴν διάβασιν τοῦ Ιαβοκ·<br/>And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.<br/><br/>
23. καὶ ἔλαβεν αὐτοὺς καὶ διέβη τὸν χειμάρρουν καὶ διεβίβασεν πάντα τὰ αὐτοῦ.<br/>And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.<br/><br/>
24. ὑπελείφθη δὲ Ιακωβ μόνος, καὶ ἐπάλαιεν ἄνθρωπος μετ' αὐτοῦ ἕως πρωί.<br/>And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob's thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.<br/><br/>
25. εἶδεν δὲ ὅτι οὐ δύναται πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐνάρκησεν τὸ πλάτος τοῦ μηροῦ Ιακωβ ἐν τῷ παλαίειν αὐτὸν μετ' αὐτοῦ.<br/>And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.<br/><br/>
26. καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Ἀπόστειλόν με· ἀνέβη γὰρ ὁ ὄρθρος. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Οὐ μή σε ἀποστείλω, ἐὰν μή με εὐλογήσῃς.<br/>And he said to him, What is your name? and he answered, Jacob.<br/><br/>
27. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Τί τὸ ὄνομά σού ἐστιν; ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Ιακωβ.<br/>And he said to him, Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name; for you have prevailed with God, and shall be mighty with men.<br/><br/>
28. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Οὐ κληθήσεται ἔτι τὸ ὄνομά σου Ιακωβ, ἀλλὰ Ισραηλ ἔσται τὸ ὄνομά σου, ὅτι ἐνίσχυσας μετὰ θεοῦ καὶ μετὰ ἀνθρώπων δυνατός.<br/>And Jacob asked and said, Tell me your name; and he said, Why do you ask after my name? and he blessed him there.<br/><br/>
29. ἠρώτησεν δὲ Ιακωβ καὶ εἶπεν Ἀνάγγειλόν μοι τὸ ὄνομά σου. καὶ εἶπεν Ἵνα τί τοῦτο ἐρωτᾷς τὸ ὄνομά μου; καὶ ηὐλόγησεν αὐτὸν ἐκεῖ.<br/>And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; for, [said he,] I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.<br/><br/>
30. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Ιακωβ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ τόπου ἐκείνου Εἶδος θεοῦ· εἶδον γὰρ θεὸν πρόσωπον πρὸς πρόσωπον, καὶ ἐσώθη μου ἡ ψυχή.<br/>And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.<br/><br/>
31. ἀνέτειλεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ ἥλιος, ἡνίκα παρῆλθεν τὸ Εἶδος τοῦ θεοῦ· αὐτὸς δὲ ἐπέσκαζεν τῷ μηρῷ αὐτοῦ.<br/>Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because [the angel] touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob-- [even] the sinew which was benumbed.<br/><br/>
32. ἕνεκεν τούτου οὐ μὴ φάγωσιν οἱ υἱοὶ Ισραηλ τὸ νεῦρον, ὃ ἐνάρκησεν, ὅ ἐστιν ἐπὶ τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης, ὅτι ἥψατο τοῦ πλάτους τοῦ μηροῦ Ιακωβ τοῦ νεύρου καὶ ἐνάρκησεν.<br/>Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed which is on the broad part of the thigh until this day because [the angel] touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob-- [even] the sinew which was benumbed.<br/><br/>

16. ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ιωσηφ τῷ Φαραω εἶπεν Ἄνευ τοῦ θεοῦ οὐκ ἀποκριθήσεται τὸ σωτήριον Φαραω.<br/>And Joseph answered Pharao and said, Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharao.<br/><br/>
17. ἐλάλησεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιωσηφ λέγων Ἑν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου ᾤμην ἑστάναι παρὰ τὸ χεῖλος τοῦ ποταμοῦ,<br/>And Pharao spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream methought I stood by the bank of the river;
18. καὶ ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ ἀνέβαινον ἑπτὰ βόες καλαὶ τῷ εἴδει καὶ ἐκλεκταὶ ταῖς σαρξὶν καὶ ἐνέμοντο ἐν τῷ ἄχει·<br/>and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows well-favoured and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.<br/><br/>
19. καὶ ἰδοὺ ἑπτὰ βόες ἕτεραι ἀνέβαινον ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἐκ τοῦ ποταμοῦ πονηραὶ καὶ αἰσχραὶ τῷ εἴδει καὶ λεπταὶ ταῖς σαρξίν, οἵας οὐκ εἶδον τοιαύτας ἐν ὅλῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ αἰσχροτέρας·<br/>And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil and ill-favoured and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
20. καὶ κατέφαγον αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ αἰσχραὶ καὶ λεπταὶ τὰς ἑπτὰ βόας τὰς πρώτας τὰς καλὰς καὶ ἐκλεκτάς,<br/>And the seven ill-favoured and thin cows ate up the seven first good and choice cows.<br/><br/>
21. καὶ εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς κοιλίας αὐτῶν καὶ οὐ διάδηλοι ἐγένοντο ὅτι εἰσῆλθον εἰς τὰς κοιλίας αὐτῶν, καὶ αἱ ὄψεις αὐτῶν αἰσχραὶ καθὰ καὶ τὴν ἀρχήν. ἐξεγερθεὶς δὲ ἐκοιμήθην<br/>And they went into their bellies; and it was not perceptible that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance was ill-favoured, as also at the beginning; and after I awoke I slept,
22. καὶ εἶδον πάλιν ἐν τῷ ὕπνῳ μου, καὶ ὥσπερ ἑπτὰ στάχυες ἀνέβαινον ἐν πυθμένι ἑνὶ πλήρεις καὶ καλοί·<br/>and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears came up on one stem, full and good.<br/><br/>
23. ἄλλοι δὲ ἑπτὰ στάχυες λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι ἀνεφύοντο ἐχόμενοι αὐτῶν·<br/>And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the wind, sprang up close to them.<br/><br/>
24. καὶ κατέπιον οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι τοὺς ἑπτὰ στάχυας τοὺς καλοὺς καὶ τοὺς πλήρεις. εἶπα οὖν τοῖς ἐξηγηταῖς, καὶ οὐκ ἦν ὁ ἀπαγγέλλων μοι.<br/>And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.<br/><br/>
25. Καὶ εἶπεν Ιωσηφ τῷ Φαραω Τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραω ἕν ἐστιν· ὅσα ὁ θεὸς ποιεῖ, ἔδειξεν τῷ Φαραω.<br/>And Joseph said to Pharao, The dream of Pharao is one; whatever God does, he has shewn to Pharao.<br/><br/>
26. αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ καλαὶ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστίν, καὶ οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ καλοὶ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστίν· τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραω ἕν ἐστιν.<br/>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharao is one.<br/><br/>
27. καὶ αἱ ἑπτὰ βόες αἱ λεπταὶ αἱ ἀναβαίνουσαι ὀπίσω αὐτῶν ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἐστίν, καὶ οἱ ἑπτὰ στάχυες οἱ λεπτοὶ καὶ ἀνεμόφθοροι ἔσονται ἑπτὰ ἔτη λιμοῦ.<br/>And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there shall be seven years of famine.<br/><br/>
28. τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα, ὃ εἴρηκα Φαραω Ὅσα ὁ θεὸς ποιεῖ, ἔδειξεν τῷ Φαραω,<br/>And as for the word which I have told Pharao, whatsoever God intends to do, he has shewn to Pharao:
29. ἰδοὺ ἑπτὰ ἔτη ἔρχεται εὐθηνία πολλὴ ἐν πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ·<br/>behold, for seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
30. ἥξει δὲ ἑπτὰ ἔτη λιμοῦ μετὰ ταῦτα, καὶ ἐπιλήσονται τῆς πλησμονῆς ἐν ὅλῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἀναλώσει ὁ λιμὸς τὴν γῆν,<br/>But there shall come seven years of famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.<br/><br/>
31. καὶ οὐκ ἐπιγνωσθήσεται ἡ εὐθηνία ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ τοῦ ἐσομένου μετὰ ταῦτα· ἰσχυρὸς γὰρ ἔσται σφόδρα.<br/>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.<br/><br/>
32. περὶ δὲ τοῦ δευτερῶσαι τὸ ἐνύπνιον Φαραω δίς, ὅτι ἀληθὲς ἔσται τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ ταχυνεῖ ὁ θεὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι αὐτό.<br/>And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharao twice, [it is] because the saying which is from God shall be true, and God will hasten to accomplish it.<br/><br/>
33. νῦν οὖν σκέψαι ἄνθρωπον φρόνιμον καὶ συνετὸν καὶ κατάστησον αὐτὸν ἐπὶ γῆς Αἰγύπτου·<br/>Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and set him over the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
34. καὶ ποιησάτω Φαραω καὶ καταστησάτω τοπάρχας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, καὶ ἀποπεμπτωσάτωσαν πάντα τὰ γενήματα τῆς γῆς Αἰγύπτου τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν τῆς εὐθηνίας<br/>And let Pharao make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years of the plenty.<br/><br/>
35. καὶ συναγαγέτωσαν πάντα τὰ βρώματα τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν τῶν ἐρχομένων τῶν καλῶν τούτων, καὶ συναχθήτω ὁ σῖτος ὑπὸ χεῖρα Φαραω, βρώματα ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν φυλαχθήτω·<br/>And let them gather all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be gathered under the hand of Pharao; let food be kept in the cities.<br/><br/>
36. καὶ ἔσται τὰ βρώματα πεφυλαγμένα τῇ γῇ εἰς τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τοῦ λιμοῦ, ἃ ἔσονται ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ οὐκ ἐκτριβήσεται ἡ γῆ ἐν τῷ λιμῷ.<br/>And the stored food shall be for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.<br/><br/>
37. Ἤρεσεν δὲ τὰ ῥήματα ἐναντίον Φαραω καὶ ἐναντίον πάντων τῶν παίδων αὐτοῦ,<br/>And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharao, and in the sight of all his servants.<br/><br/>
38. καὶ εἶπεν Φαραω πᾶσιν τοῖς παισὶν αὐτοῦ Μὴ εὑρήσομεν ἄνθρωπον τοιοῦτον, ὃς ἔχει πνεῦμα θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ;<br/>And Pharao said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who has the Spirit of God in him?
39. εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιωσηφ Ἑπειδὴ ἔδειξεν ὁ θεός σοι πάντα ταῦτα, οὐκ ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος φρονιμώτερος καὶ συνετώτερός σου·<br/>And Pharao said to Joseph, Since God has shewed you all these things, there is not a wiser or more prudent man than you.<br/><br/>
40. σὺ ἔσῃ ἐπὶ τῷ οἴκῳ μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τῷ στόματί σου ὑπακούσεται πᾶς ὁ λαός μου· πλὴν τὸν θρόνον ὑπερέξω σου ἐγώ.<br/>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall be obedient to your word; only in the throne will I excel you.<br/><br/>
41. εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιωσηφ Ἰδοὺ καθίστημί σε σήμερον ἐπὶ πάσης γῆς Αἰγύπτου.<br/>And Pharao said to Joseph, Behold, I set you this day over all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
42. καὶ περιελόμενος Φαραω τὸν δακτύλιον ἀπὸ τῆς χειρὸς αὐτοῦ περιέθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν χεῖρα Ιωσηφ καὶ ἐνέδυσεν αὐτὸν στολὴν βυσσίνην καὶ περιέθηκεν κλοιὸν χρυσοῦν περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ·<br/>And Pharao took his ring off his hand, and put it on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold about his neck.<br/><br/>
43. καὶ ἀνεβίβασεν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ τὸ ἅρμα τὸ δεύτερον τῶν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐκήρυξεν ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ κῆρυξ· καὶ κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἐφ' ὅλης γῆς Αἰγύπτου.<br/>And he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
44. εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω τῷ Ιωσηφ Ἑγὼ Φαραω· ἄνευ σοῦ οὐκ ἐξαρεῖ οὐθεὶς τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου.<br/>And Pharao said to Joseph, I am Pharao; without you no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
45. καὶ ἐκάλεσεν Φαραω τὸ ὄνομα Ιωσηφ Ψονθομφανηχ· καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν Ασεννεθ θυγατέρα Πετεφρη ἱερέως Ἡλίου πόλεως αὐτῷ γυναῖκα.<br/>And Pharao called the name of Joseph, Psonthomphanech; and he gave him Aseneth, the daughter of Petephre, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.<br/><br/>
46. Ιωσηφ δὲ ἦν ἐτῶν τριάκοντα, ὅτε ἔστη ἐναντίον Φαραω βασιλέως Αἰγύπτου. Ἑξῆλθεν δὲ Ιωσηφ ἐκ προσώπου Φαραω καὶ διῆλθεν πᾶσαν γῆν Αἰγύπτου.<br/>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharao, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharao, and went through all the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
47. καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡ γῆ ἐν τοῖς ἑπτὰ ἔτεσιν τῆς εὐθηνίας δράγματα·<br/>And the land produced, in the seven years of plenty, [whole] handfuls [of corn].<br/><br/>
48. καὶ συνήγαγεν πάντα τὰ βρώματα τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐτῶν, ἐν οἷς ἦν ἡ εὐθηνία ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ ἔθηκεν τὰ βρώματα ἐν ταῖς πόλεσιν, βρώματα τῶν πεδίων τῆς πόλεως τῶν κύκλῳ αὐτῆς ἔθηκεν ἐν αὐτῇ.<br/>And he gathered all the food of the seven years, in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.<br/><br/>
49. καὶ συνήγαγεν Ιωσηφ σῖτον ὡσεὶ τὴν ἄμμον τῆς θαλάσσης πολὺν σφόδρα, ἕως οὐκ ἠδύναντο ἀριθμῆσαι, οὐ γὰρ ἦν ἀριθμός.<br/>And Joseph gathered very much corn as the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number [of it].<br/><br/>
50. Τῷ δὲ Ιωσηφ ἐγένοντο υἱοὶ δύο πρὸ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τοῦ λιμοῦ, οὓς ἔτεκεν αὐτῷ Ασεννεθ θυγάτηρ Πετεφρη ἱερέως Ἡλίου πόλεως.<br/>And to Joseph were born two sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Aseneth, the daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.<br/><br/>
51. ἐκάλεσεν δὲ Ιωσηφ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ πρωτοτόκου Μανασση, ὅτι Ἑπιλαθέσθαι με ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς πάντων τῶν πόνων μου καὶ πάντων τῶν τοῦ πατρός μου.<br/>And Joseph called the name of the first-born, Manasse; for God, [said he], has made me forget all my toils, and all my father's house.<br/><br/>
52. τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τοῦ δευτέρου ἐκάλεσεν Εφραιμ, ὅτι Ηὔξησέν με ὁ θεὸς ἐν γῇ ταπεινώσεώς μου.<br/>And he called the name of the second, Ephraim; for God, [said he], has increased me in the land of my humiliation.<br/><br/>
53. Παρῆλθον δὲ τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τῆς εὐθηνίας, ἃ ἐγένοντο ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ,<br/>And the seven years of plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt.<br/><br/>
54. καὶ ἤρξαντο τὰ ἑπτὰ ἔτη τοῦ λιμοῦ ἔρχεσθαι, καθὰ εἶπεν Ιωσηφ. καὶ ἐγένετο λιμὸς ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ, ἐν δὲ πάσῃ γῇ Αἰγύπτου ἦσαν ἄρτοι.<br/>And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.<br/><br/>
55. καὶ ἐπείνασεν πᾶσα ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου, ἐκέκραξεν δὲ ὁ λαὸς πρὸς Φαραω περὶ ἄρτων· εἶπεν δὲ Φαραω πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις Πορεύεσθε πρὸς Ιωσηφ, καὶ ὃ ἐὰν εἴπῃ ὑμῖν, ποιήσατε.<br/>And all the land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharao for bread. And Pharao said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatsoever he shall tell you.<br/><br/>

<br/><br/><br/>## 42<br/><br/>
1. Ἰδὼν δὲ Ιακωβ ὅτι ἔστιν πρᾶσις ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, εἶπεν τοῖς υἱοῖς αὐτοῦ Ἵνα τί ῥᾳθυμεῖτε;<br/>And Jacob having seen that there was a sale [of corn] in Egypt, said to his sons, Why are you indolent?
2. ἰδοὺ ἀκήκοα ὅτι ἔστιν σῖτος ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ· κατάβητε ἐκεῖ καὶ πρίασθε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα, ἵνα ζῶμεν καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν.<br/>Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt; go down thither, and buy for us a little food, that we may live, and not die.<br/><br/>
3. κατέβησαν δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ιωσηφ οἱ δέκα πρίασθαι σῖτον ἐξ Αἰγύπτου·<br/>And the ten brethren of Joseph went down to buy corn out of Egypt.<br/><br/>
4. τὸν δὲ Βενιαμιν τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ιωσηφ οὐκ ἀπέστειλεν μετὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτοῦ· εἶπεν γάρ Μήποτε συμβῇ αὐτῷ μαλακία.<br/>But [Jacob] sent not Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brethren; for he said, Lest, haply, disease befall him.<br/><br/>

6. Ιωσηφ δὲ ἦν ἄρχων τῆς γῆς, οὗτος ἐπώλει παντὶ τῷ λαῷ τῆς γῆς· ἐλθόντες δὲ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ Ιωσηφ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.<br/>And Joseph was ruler of the land; he sold to all the people of the land. And the brethren of Joseph, having come, did reverence to him, [bowing] with the face to the ground.<br/><br/>

11. πάντες ἐσμὲν υἱοὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου· εἰρηνικοί ἐσμεν, οὐκ εἰσὶν οἱ παῖδές σου κατάσκοποι.<br/>we are all sons of one man; we are peaceable, your servants are not spies.<br/><br/>
12. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Οὐχί, ἀλλὰ τὰ ἴχνη τῆς γῆς ἤλθατε ἰδεῖν.<br/>And he said to them, Nay, but you are come to observe the marks of the land.<br/><br/>
13. οἱ δὲ εἶπαν Δώδεκά ἐσμεν οἱ παῖδές σου ἀδελφοὶ ἐν γῇ Χανααν, καὶ ἰδοὺ ὁ νεώτερος μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σήμερον, ὁ δὲ ἕτερος οὐχ ὑπάρχει.<br/>And they said, We your servants are twelve brethren, in the land of Chanaan; and, behold, the youngest is with our father to-day, but the other one is not.<br/><br/>

15. ἐν τούτῳ φανεῖσθε· νὴ τὴν ὑγίειαν Φαραω, οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθητε ἐντεῦθεν, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος ἔλθῃ ὧδε.<br/>herein shall you be manifested; by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come hither.<br/><br/>
16. ἀποστείλατε ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕνα καὶ λάβετε τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἀπάχθητε ἕως τοῦ φανερὰ γενέσθαι τὰ ῥήματα ὑμῶν, εἰ ἀληθεύετε ἢ οὔ· εἰ δὲ μή, νὴ τὴν ὑγίειαν Φαραω, ἦ μὴν κατάσκοποί ἐστε.<br/>Send one of you, and take your brother; and go you to prison, till your words be clear, whether you speak the truth or not; but, if not, by the health of Pharao, verily you are spies.<br/><br/>

18. Εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ Τοῦτο ποιήσατε καὶ ζήσεσθε - τὸν θεὸν γὰρ ἐγὼ φοβοῦμαι - ·<br/>And he said to them on the third day, This do, and you shall live, for I fear God.<br/><br/>
19. εἰ εἰρηνικοί ἐστε, ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν εἷς κατασχεθήτω ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ, αὐτοὶ δὲ βαδίσατε καὶ ἀπαγάγετε τὸν ἀγορασμὸν τῆς σιτοδοσίας ὑμῶν<br/>If you be peaceable, let one of your brethren be detained in prison; but go, and carry back the corn you have purchased.<br/><br/>
20. καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν τὸν νεώτερον ἀγάγετε πρός με, καὶ πιστευθήσονται τὰ ῥήματα ὑμῶν· εἰ δὲ μή, ἀποθανεῖσθε. ἐποίησαν δὲ οὕτως. -<br/>And bring your younger brother to me, and your words shall be believed; but, if not, you shall die. And they did so.<br/><br/>
21. καὶ εἶπεν ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ Ναί· ἐν ἁμαρτίᾳ γάρ ἐσμεν περὶ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ ἡμῶν, ὅτι ὑπερείδομεν τὴν θλῖψιν τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ, ὅτε κατεδέετο ἡμῶν, καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσαμεν αὐτοῦ· ἕνεκεν τούτου ἐπῆλθεν ἐφ' ἡμᾶς ἡ θλῖψις αὕτη.<br/>And each said to his brother, Yes, indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the aguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we listened not to him; and therefore has this affliction come upon us.<br/><br/>
22. ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ρουβην εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Οὐκ ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν λέγων Μὴ ἀδικήσητε τὸ παιδάριον; καὶ οὐκ εἰσηκούσατέ μου· καὶ ἰδοὺ τὸ αἷμα αὐτοῦ ἐκζητεῖται.<br/>And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and you heard me not? and, behold, his blood is required.<br/><br/>

24. ἀποστραφεὶς δὲ ἀπ' αὐτῶν ἔκλαυσεν Ιωσηφ. - καὶ πάλιν προσῆλθεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἔλαβεν τὸν Συμεων ἀπ' αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδησεν αὐτὸν ἐναντίον αὐτῶν.<br/>And Joseph turned away from them, and wept; and again he came to them, and spoke to them; and he took Symeon from them, and bound him before their eyes.<br/><br/>

27. λύσας δὲ εἷς τὸν μάρσιππον αὐτοῦ δοῦναι χορτάσματα τοῖς ὄνοις αὐτοῦ, οὗ κατέλυσαν, εἶδεν τὸν δεσμὸν τοῦ ἀργυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἦν ἐπάνω τοῦ στόματος τοῦ μαρσίππου·<br/>And one having opened his sack to give his asses fodder, at the place where they rested, saw also his bundle of money, for it was on the mouth of his sack.<br/><br/>
28. καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ Ἀπεδόθη μοι τὸ ἀργύριον, καὶ ἰδοὺ τοῦτο ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ μου. καὶ ἐξέστη ἡ καρδία αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐταράχθησαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους λέγοντες Τί τοῦτο ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς ἡμῖν;<br/>And he said to his brethren, My money has been restored to me, and behold this is in my sack. And their heart was wonder-struck, and they were troubled, saying one to another, What is this that God has done to us?

31. εἴπαμεν δὲ αὐτῷ Εἰρηνικοί ἐσμεν, οὔκ ἐσμεν κατάσκοποι·<br/>And we said to him, We are men of peace, we are not spies.<br/><br/>
32. δώδεκα ἀδελφοί ἐσμεν, υἱοὶ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν· ὁ εἷς οὐχ ὑπάρχει, ὁ δὲ μικρότερος μετὰ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν σήμερον ἐν γῇ Χανααν.<br/>We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is with his father to-day in the land of Chanaan.<br/><br/>
33. εἶπεν δὲ ἡμῖν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ κύριος τῆς γῆς Ἑν τούτῳ γνώσομαι ὅτι εἰρηνικοί ἐστε· ἀδελφὸν ἕνα ἄφετε ὧδε μετ' ἐμοῦ, τὸν δὲ ἀγορασμὸν τῆς σιτοδοσίας τοῦ οἴκου ὑμῶν λαβόντες ἀπέλθατε<br/>And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Herein shall I know that you are peaceable; leave one brother here with me, and having taken the corn you have purchased for your family, depart.<br/><br/>
34. καὶ ἀγάγετε πρός με τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν τὸν νεώτερον, καὶ γνώσομαι ὅτι οὐ κατάσκοποί ἐστε, ἀλλ' ὅτι εἰρηνικοί ἐστε, καὶ τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν ἀποδώσω ὑμῖν, καὶ τῇ γῇ ἐμπορεύεσθε.<br/>And bring to me your younger brother; then I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are men of peace: and I will restore you your brother, and you shall trade in the land.<br/><br/>
35. ἐγένετο δὲ ἐν τῷ κατακενοῦν αὐτοὺς τοὺς σάκκους αὐτῶν καὶ ἦν ἑκάστου ὁ δεσμὸς τοῦ ἀργυρίου ἐν τῷ σάκκῳ αὐτῶν· καὶ εἶδον τοὺς δεσμοὺς τοῦ ἀργυρίου αὐτῶν, αὐτοὶ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν.<br/>And it came to pass as they were emptying their sacks, there was each man's bundle of money in his sack; and they and their father saw their bundles of money, and they were afraid.<br/><br/>
36. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιακωβ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν Ἑμὲ ἠτεκνώσατε· Ιωσηφ οὐκ ἔστιν, Συμεων οὐκ ἔστιν, καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν λήμψεσθε· ἐπ' ἐμὲ ἐγένετο πάντα ταῦτα.<br/>And their father Jacob said to them, Ye have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will you take Benjamin? all these things have come upon me.<br/><br/>
37. εἶπεν δὲ Ρουβην τῷ πατρὶ αὐτοῦ λέγων Τοὺς δύο υἱούς μου ἀπόκτεινον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀγάγω αὐτὸν πρὸς σέ δὸς αὐτὸν εἰς τὴν χεῖρά μου, κἀγὼ ἀνάξω αὐτὸν πρὸς σέ.<br/>And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to you; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you.<br/><br/>
38. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Οὐ καταβήσεται ὁ υἱός μου μεθ' ὑμῶν, ὅτι ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν καὶ αὐτὸς μόνος καταλέλειπται· καὶ συμβήσεται αὐτὸν μαλακισθῆναι ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ, ᾗ ἂν πορεύησθε, καὶ κατάξετέ μου τὸ γῆρας μετὰ λύπης εἰς ᾅδου.<br/>But he said, My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and [suppose] it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which you go, then you shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.<br/><br/>

1. Ὁ δὲ λιμὸς ἐνίσχυσεν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.<br/>But the famine prevailed in the land.<br/><br/>
2. ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα συνετέλεσαν καταφαγεῖν τὸν σῖτον, ὃν ἤνεγκαν ἐξ Αἰγύπτου, καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ πατὴρ αὐτῶν Πάλιν πορευθέντες πρίασθε ἡμῖν μικρὰ βρώματα.<br/>And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food.<br/><br/>
3. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ Ιουδας λέγων Διαμαρτυρίᾳ διαμεμαρτύρηται ἡμῖν ὁ ἄνθρωπος λέγων Οὐκ ὄψεσθε τὸ πρόσωπόν μου, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος μεθ' ὑμῶν ᾖ.<br/>And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord of the country, positively testified to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.<br/><br/>
4. εἰ μὲν οὖν ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν μεθ' ἡμῶν, καταβησόμεθα καὶ ἀγοράσωμέν σοι βρώματα·<br/>If, then, you send our brother with us, we will go down, and buy you food;
5. εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀποστέλλεις τὸν ἀδελφὸν ἡμῶν μεθ' ἡμῶν, οὐ πορευσόμεθα· ὁ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος εἶπεν ἡμῖν λέγων Οὐκ ὄψεσθέ μου τὸ πρόσωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος μεθ' ὑμῶν ᾖ.<br/>but if you send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.<br/><br/>
6. εἶπεν δὲ Ισραηλ Τί ἐκακοποιήσατέ με ἀναγγείλαντες τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ εἰ ἔστιν ὑμῖν ἀδελφός;<br/>And Israel said, Why did you harm me, inasmuch as you told the man that you had a brother?
7. οἱ δὲ εἶπαν Ἑρωτῶν ἐπηρώτησεν ἡμᾶς ὁ ἄνθρωπος καὶ τὴν γενεὰν ἡμῶν λέγων Εἰ ἔτι ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ζῇ; εἰ ἔστιν ὑμῖν ἀδελφός; καὶ ἀπηγγείλαμεν αὐτῷ κατὰ τὴν ἐπερώτησιν ταύτην. μὴ ᾔδειμεν εἰ ἐρεῖ ἡμῖν Ἀγάγετε τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὑμῶν;<br/>And they said, The man closely questioned us about our family also, saying, Does your father yet live, and have you a brother? and we answered him according to this question: did we know that he would say to us, Bring your brother?
8. εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας πρὸς Ισραηλ τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ Ἀπόστειλον τὸ παιδάριον μετ' ἐμοῦ, καὶ ἀναστάντες πορευσόμεθα, ἵνα ζῶμεν καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ σὺ καὶ ἡ ἀποσκευὴ ἡμῶν.<br/>And Judas said to his father Israel, Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live and not die, both we and you, and our store.<br/><br/>

15. Λαβόντες δὲ οἱ ἄνδρες τὰ δῶρα ταῦτα καὶ τὸ ἀργύριον διπλοῦν ἔλαβον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν καὶ ἀναστάντες κατέβησαν εἰς Αἴγυπτον καὶ ἔστησαν ἐναντίον Ιωσηφ.<br/>And the men having taken these presents, and the double money, took in their hands also Benjamin; and they rose up and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.<br/><br/>
16. εἶδεν δὲ Ιωσηφ αὐτοὺς καὶ τὸν Βενιαμιν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν ὁμομήτριον καὶ εἶπεν τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ Εἰσάγαγε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν καὶ σφάξον θύματα καὶ ἑτοίμασον· μετ' ἐμοῦ γὰρ φάγονται οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἄρτους τὴν μεσημβρίαν.<br/>And Joseph saw them and his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said to the steward of his household, Bring the men into the house, and slay beasts and make ready, for the men are to eat bread with me at noon.<br/><br/>

18. ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ὅτι εἰσήχθησαν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Ιωσηφ, εἶπαν Διὰ τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ ἀποστραφὲν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ἡμῶν τὴν ἀρχὴν ἡμεῖς εἰσαγόμεθα τοῦ συκοφαντῆσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ ἐπιθέσθαι ἡμῖν τοῦ λαβεῖν ἡμᾶς εἰς παῖδας καὶ τοὺς ὄνους ἡμῶν.<br/>And the men, when they perceived that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to inform against us, and lay it to our charge; to take us for servants, and our asses.<br/><br/>
19. προσελθόντες δὲ πρὸς τὸν ἄνθρωπον τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ οἴκου Ιωσηφ ἐλάλησαν αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ πυλῶνι τοῦ οἴκου<br/>And having approached the man who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the house,
20. λέγοντες Δεόμεθα, κύριε· κατέβημεν τὴν ἀρχὴν πρίασθαι βρώματα·<br/>saying, We pray [you], Sir; we came down at first to buy food.<br/><br/>
21. ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤλθομεν εἰς τὸ καταλῦσαι καὶ ἠνοίξαμεν τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν, καὶ τόδε τὸ ἀργύριον ἑκάστου ἐν τῷ μαρσίππῳ αὐτοῦ· τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν ἐν σταθμῷ ἀπεστρέψαμεν νῦν ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν ἡμῶν<br/>And it came to pass, when we came to unlade, and opened our sacks, [there was] also this money of each in his sack; we have now brought back our money by weight in our hands.<br/><br/>
22. καὶ ἀργύριον ἕτερον ἠνέγκαμεν μεθ' ἑαυτῶν ἀγοράσαι βρώματα· οὐκ οἴδαμεν, τίς ἐνέβαλεν τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς τοὺς μαρσίππους ἡμῶν.<br/>And we have brought other money with us to buy food; we know not who put the money into our sacks.<br/><br/>
23. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ἵλεως ὑμῖν, μὴ φοβεῖσθε· ὁ θεὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν ἔδωκεν ὑμῖν θησαυροὺς ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ὑμῶν, τὸ δὲ ἀργύριον ὑμῶν εὐδοκιμοῦν ἀπέχω. καὶ ἐξήγαγεν πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὸν Συμεων<br/>And he said to them, [God deal] mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you treasures in your sacks, and I have enough of your good money.

24. καὶ ἤνεγκεν ὕδωρ νίψαι τοὺς πόδας αὐτῶν καὶ ἔδωκεν χορτάσματα τοῖς ὄνοις αὐτῶν.<br/>And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.<br/><br/>
25. ἡτοίμασαν δὲ τὰ δῶρα ἕως τοῦ ἐλθεῖν Ιωσηφ μεσημβρίας· ἤκουσαν γὰρ ὅτι ἐκεῖ μέλλει ἀριστᾶν.<br/>And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.<br/><br/>
26. Εἰσῆλθεν δὲ Ιωσηφ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ τὰ δῶρα, ἃ εἶχον ἐν ταῖς χερσὶν αὐτῶν, εἰς τὸν οἶκον καὶ προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ ἐπὶ πρόσωπον ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν.<br/>And Joseph entered into the house, and they brought him the gifts which they had in their hands, into the house; and they did him reverence with their face to the ground.<br/><br/>
27. ἠρώτησεν δὲ αὐτούς Πῶς ἔχετε; καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς Εἰ ὑγιαίνει ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ πρεσβύτερος, ὃν εἴπατε; ἔτι ζῇ;<br/>And he asked them, How are ye? and he said to them, Is your father, the old man of whom you spoke, well? Does he yet live?
28. οἱ δὲ εἶπαν Ὑγιαίνει ὁ παῖς σου ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν, ἔτι ζῇ. καὶ εἶπεν Εὐλογητὸς ὁ ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖνος τῷ θεῷ. καὶ κύψαντες προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ.<br/>And they said, Your servant our father is well; he is yet alive. And he said, Blessed be that man by God;-- and they bowed, and did him reverence.<br/><br/>
29. ἀναβλέψας δὲ τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς Ιωσηφ εἶδεν Βενιαμιν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν ὁμομήτριον καὶ εἶπεν Οὗτος ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος, ὃν εἴπατε πρός με ἀγαγεῖν; καὶ εἶπεν Ὁ θεὸς ἐλεήσαι σε, τέκνον.<br/>And Joseph lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, born of the same mother; and he said, Is this your younger brother, whom you spoke of bringing to me? and he said, God have mercy on you, my son.<br/><br/>
30. ἐταράχθη δὲ Ιωσηφ - συνεστρέφετο γὰρ τὰ ἔντερα αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ - καὶ ἐζήτει κλαῦσαι· εἰσελθὼν δὲ εἰς τὸ ταμιεῖον ἔκλαυσεν ἐκεῖ.<br/>And Joseph was troubled, for his bowels yearned over his brother, and he sought to weep; and he went into his chamber, and wept there.<br/><br/>
31. καὶ νιψάμενος τὸ πρόσωπον ἐξελθὼν ἐνεκρατεύσατο καὶ εἶπεν Παράθετε ἄρτους.<br/>And he washed his face and came out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.<br/><br/>
32. καὶ παρέθηκαν αὐτῷ μόνῳ καὶ αὐτοῖς καθ' ἑαυτοὺς καὶ τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις τοῖς συνδειπνοῦσιν μετ' αὐτοῦ καθ' ἑαυτούς· οὐ γὰρ ἐδύναντο οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι συνεσθίειν μετὰ τῶν Εβραίων ἄρτους, βδέλυγμα γάρ ἐστιν τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις.<br/>And they set on [bread] for him alone, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians feasting with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.<br/><br/>
33. ἐκάθισαν δὲ ἐναντίον αὐτοῦ, ὁ πρωτότοκος κατὰ τὰ πρεσβεῖα αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ νεώτερος κατὰ τὴν νεότητα αὐτοῦ· ἐξίσταντο δὲ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἕκαστος πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ.<br/>And they sat before him, the first-born according to his seniority, and the younger according to his youth; and the men looked with amazement every one at his brother.<br/><br/>
34. ἦραν δὲ μερίδας παρ' αὐτοῦ πρὸς αὐτούς· ἐμεγαλύνθη δὲ ἡ μερὶς Βενιαμιν παρὰ τὰς μερίδας πάντων πενταπλασίως πρὸς τὰς ἐκείνων. ἔπιον δὲ καὶ ἐμεθύσθησαν μετ' αὐτοῦ.<br/>And they took their portions from him to themselves; but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as the portions of [the others]. And they drank and were filled with drink with him.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>## 44<br/><br/>
1. Καὶ ἐνετείλατο Ιωσηφ τῷ ὄντι ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ λέγων Πλήσατε τοὺς μαρσίππους τῶν ἀνθρώπων βρωμάτων, ὅσα ἐὰν δύνωνται ἆραι, καὶ ἐμβάλατε ἑκάστου τὸ ἀργύριον ἐπὶ τοῦ στόματος τοῦ μαρσίππου<br/>And Joseph charged the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put the money of each in the mouth of his sack.<br/><br/>
2. καὶ τὸ κόνδυ μου τὸ ἀργυροῦν ἐμβάλατε εἰς τὸν μάρσιππον τοῦ νεωτέρου καὶ τὴν τιμὴν τοῦ σίτου αὐτοῦ. ἐγενήθη δὲ κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα Ιωσηφ, καθὼς εἶπεν. -<br/>And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.<br/><br/>
3. τὸ πρωῒ διέφαυσεν, καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἀπεστάλησαν, αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ὄνοι αὐτῶν.<br/>The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.<br/><br/>
4. ἐξελθόντων δὲ αὐτῶν τὴν πόλιν [οὐκ ἀπέσχον μακράν καὶ Ιωσηφ εἶπεν τῷ ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ Ἀναστὰς ἐπιδίωξον ὀπίσω τῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ καταλήμψῃ αὐτοὺς καὶ ἐρεῖς αὐτοῖς Τί ὅτι ἀνταπεδώκατε πονηρὰ ἀντὶ καλῶν;<br/>And when they had gone out of the city, [and] were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and you shall overtake them, and say to them, Why have you returned evil for good?
5. ἵνα τί ἐκλέψατέ μου τὸ κόνδυ τὸ ἀργυροῦν; οὐ τοῦτό ἐστιν, ἐν ᾧ πίνει ὁ κύριός μου; αὐτὸς δὲ οἰωνισμῷ οἰωνίζεται ἐν αὐτῷ. πονηρὰ συντετέλεσθε, ἃ πεποιήκατε.<br/>Why have you stolen my silver cup? is it not this out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with it; you have accomplished evil in that which you have done.<br/><br/>
6. εὑρὼν δὲ αὐτοὺς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα.<br/>And he found them, and spoke to them according to these words.<br/><br/>
7. οἱ δὲ εἶπον αὐτῷ Ἵνα τί λαλεῖ ὁ κύριος κατὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα; μὴ γένοιτο τοῖς παισίν σου ποιῆσαι κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο.<br/>And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from your servants to do according to this word.<br/><br/>
8. εἰ τὸ μὲν ἀργύριον, ὃ εὕρομεν ἐν τοῖς μαρσίπποις ἡμῶν, ἀπεστρέψαμεν πρὸς σὲ ἐκ γῆς Χανααν, πῶς ἂν κλέψαιμεν ἐκ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ κυρίου σου ἀργύριον ἢ χρυσίον;<br/>If we brought back to you out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of your lord?
9. παρ' ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ τῶν παίδων σου, ἀποθνῃσκέτω· καὶ ἡμεῖς δὲ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν.<br/>With whomsoever of your servants you shall find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.<br/><br/>
10. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Καὶ νῦν ὡς λέγετε, οὕτως ἔσται· ὁ ἄνθρωπος, παρ' ᾧ ἂν εὑρεθῇ τὸ κόνδυ, αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἔσεσθε καθαροί.<br/>And he said, Now then it shall be as you say; with whomsoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant, and you shall be clear.<br/><br/>

16. εἶπεν δὲ Ιουδας Τί ἀντεροῦμεν τῷ κυρίῳ ἢ τί λαλήσωμεν ἢ τί δικαιωθῶμεν; ὁ δὲ θεὸς εὗρεν τὴν ἀδικίαν τῶν παίδων σου. ἰδού ἐσμεν οἰκέται τῷ κυρίῳ ἡμῶν, καὶ ἡμεῖς καὶ παρ' ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ.<br/>And Judas said, What shall we answer to our lord, or what shall we say, or how should we be justified? whereas God has discovered the unrighteousness of your servants; behold, we are slaves to our lord, both we and he with whom the cup has been found.<br/><br/>
17. εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ Μή μοι γένοιτο ποιῆσαι τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο· ὁ ἄνθρωπος, παρ' ᾧ εὑρέθη τὸ κόνδυ, αὐτὸς ἔσται μου παῖς, ὑμεῖς δὲ ἀνάβητε μετὰ σωτηρίας πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ὑμῶν.<br/>And Joseph said, Far be it from me to do this thing; the man with whom the cup has been found, he shall be my servant; but do you go up with safety to your father.<br/><br/>
18. Ἑγγίσας δὲ αὐτῷ Ιουδας εἶπεν Δέομαι, κύριε, λαλησάτω ὁ παῖς σου ῥῆμα ἐναντίον σου, καὶ μὴ θυμωθῇς τῷ παιδί σου, ὅτι σὺ εἶ μετὰ Φαραω.<br/>And Judas drew near him, and said, I pray, Sir, let your servant speak a word before you, and be not angry with your servant, for you are next to Pharao.<br/><br/>
19. κύριε, σὺ ἠρώτησας τοὺς παῖδάς σου λέγων Εἰ ἔχετε πατέρα ἢ ἀδελφόν;<br/>Sir, you asked your servants, saying, Have you a father or a brother?
20. καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ Ἔστιν ἡμῖν πατὴρ πρεσβύτερος καὶ παιδίον γήρως νεώτερον αὐτῷ, καὶ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπέθανεν, αὐτὸς δὲ μόνος ὑπελείφθη τῇ μητρὶ αὐτοῦ, ὁ δὲ πατὴρ αὐτὸν ἠγάπησεν.<br/>And we said to [my] lord, We have a father, an old man, and he has a son of his old age, a young one, and his brother is dead, and he alone has been left behind to his mother, and his father loves him.<br/><br/>

22. καὶ εἴπαμεν τῷ κυρίῳ Οὐ δυνήσεται τὸ παιδίον καταλιπεῖν τὸν πατέρα· ἐὰν δὲ καταλίπῃ τὸν πατέρα, ἀποθανεῖται.<br/>And we said to [my] lord, The child will not be able to leave his father; but if he should leave his father, he will die.<br/><br/>
23. σὺ δὲ εἶπας τοῖς παισίν σου Ἑὰν μὴ καταβῇ ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν ὁ νεώτερος μεθ' ὑμῶν, οὐ προσθήσεσθε ἔτι ἰδεῖν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου.<br/>But you said to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, you shall not see my face again.<br/><br/>

13. Σῖτος δὲ οὐκ ἦν ἐν πάσῃ τῇ γῇ· ἐνίσχυσεν γὰρ ὁ λιμὸς σφόδρα· ἐξέλιπεν δὲ ἡ γῆ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἡ γῆ Χανααν ἀπὸ τοῦ λιμοῦ.<br/>And there was no corn in all the land, for the famine prevailed greatly; and the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, fainted for the famine.<br/><br/>
14. συνήγαγεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον τὸ εὑρεθὲν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐν γῇ Χανααν τοῦ σίτου, οὗ ἠγόραζον καὶ ἐσιτομέτρει αὐτοῖς, καὶ εἰσήνεγκεν Ιωσηφ πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φαραω.<br/>And Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and the land of Chanaan, [in return for] the corn which they bought, and he distributed corn to them; and Joseph brought all the money into the house of Pharao.<br/><br/>
15. καὶ ἐξέλιπεν πᾶν τὸ ἀργύριον ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου καὶ ἐκ γῆς Χανααν. ἦλθον δὲ πάντες οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι πρὸς Ιωσηφ λέγοντες Δὸς ἡμῖν ἄρτους, καὶ ἵνα τί ἀποθνῄσκομεν ἐναντίον σου; ἐκλέλοιπεν γὰρ τὸ ἀργύριον ἡμῶν.<br/>And all the money failed out of the land of Egypt, and out of the land of Chanaan; and all the Egyptians came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread, and why do we die in your presence? for our money is spent.<br/><br/>
16. εἶπεν δὲ αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ Φέρετε τὰ κτήνη ὑμῶν, καὶ δώσω ὑμῖν ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν κτηνῶν ὑμῶν, εἰ ἐκλέλοιπεν τὸ ἀργύριον.<br/>And Joseph said to them, Bring your cattle, and I will give you bread for your cattle, if your money is spent.<br/><br/>
17. ἤγαγον δὲ τὰ κτήνη πρὸς Ιωσηφ, καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ ἄρτους ἀντὶ τῶν ἵππων καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν προβάτων καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν βοῶν καὶ ἀντὶ τῶν ὄνων καὶ ἐξέθρεψεν αὐτοὺς ἐν ἄρτοις ἀντὶ πάντων τῶν κτηνῶν αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ ἐκείνῳ. -<br/>And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in return for their horses, and for their sheep, and for their oxen, and for their asses; and Joseph maintained them with bread for all their cattle in that year.<br/><br/>
18. ἐξῆλθεν δὲ τὸ ἔτος ἐκεῖνο, καὶ ἦλθον πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἔτει τῷ δευτέρῳ καὶ εἶπαν αὐτῷ Μήποτε ἐκτριβῶμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν· εἰ γὰρ ἐκλέλοιπεν τὸ ἀργύριον καὶ τὰ ὑπάρχοντα καὶ τὰ κτήνη πρὸς σὲ τὸν κύριον, καὶ οὐχ ὑπολείπεται ἡμῖν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν ἀλλ' ἢ τὸ ἴδιον σῶμα καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν.<br/>And that year passed, and they came to him in the second year, and said to him, Must we then be consumed from before our lord? for if our money has failed, and our possessions, and our cattle, [brought] to you our lord, and there has not been left to us before our lord more than our own bodies and our land, [we are indeed destitute].<br/><br/>
19. ἵνα οὖν μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν ἐναντίον σου καὶ ἡ γῆ ἐρημωθῇ, κτῆσαι ἡμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ἡμῶν ἀντὶ ἄρτων, καὶ ἐσόμεθα ἡμεῖς καὶ ἡ γῆ ἡμῶν παῖδες Φαραω· δὸς σπέρμα, ἵνα σπείρωμεν καὶ ζῶμεν καὶ μὴ ἀποθάνωμεν καὶ ἡ γῆ οὐκ ἐρημωθήσεται.<br/>In order, then, that we die not before you, and the land be made desolate, buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharao: give seed that we may sow, and live and not die, so our land shall not be made desolate.<br/><br/>
20. καὶ ἐκτήσατο Ιωσηφ πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν τῶν Αἰγυπτίων τῷ Φαραω· ἀπέδοντο γὰρ οἱ Αἰγύπτιοι τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν τῷ Φαραω, ἐπεκράτησεν γὰρ αὐτῶν ὁ λιμός· καὶ ἐγένετο ἡ γῆ Φαραω,<br/>And Joseph bought all the land of the Egyptians, for Pharao; for the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao; for the famine prevailed against them, and the land became Pharao's.<br/><br/>
21. καὶ τὸν λαὸν κατεδουλώσατο αὐτῷ εἰς παῖδας ἀπ' ἄκρων ὁρίων Αἰγύπτου ἕως τῶν ἄκρων,<br/>And he brought the people into bondage to him, for servants, from one extremity of Egypt to the other,
22. χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱερέων μόνον· οὐκ ἐκτήσατο ταύτην Ιωσηφ, ἐν δόσει γὰρ ἔδωκεν δόμα τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν Φαραω, καὶ ἤσθιον τὴν δόσιν, ἣν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς Φαραω· διὰ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀπέδοντο τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν.<br/>except only the land of the priests; Joseph bought not this, for Pharao gave a portion in the way of gift to the priests; and they ate their portion which Pharao gave them; therefore they sold not their land.<br/><br/>
23. εἶπεν δὲ Ιωσηφ πᾶσι τοῖς Αἰγυπτίοις Ἰδοὺ κέκτημαι ὑμᾶς καὶ τὴν γῆν ὑμῶν σήμερον τῷ Φαραω· λάβετε ἑαυτοῖς σπέρμα καὶ σπείρατε τὴν γῆν,<br/>And Joseph said to all the Egyptians, Behold, I have bought you and your land this day for Pharao; take seed for you, and sow the land.<br/><br/>
24. καὶ ἔσται τὰ γενήματα αὐτῆς δώσετε τὸ πέμπτον μέρος τῷ Φαραω, τὰ δὲ τέσσαρα μέρη ἔσται ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς εἰς σπέρμα τῇ γῇ καὶ εἰς βρῶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις ὑμῶν.<br/>And there shall be the fruits of it; and you shall give the fifth part to Pharao, and the four [remaining] parts shall be for yourselves, for seed for the earth, and for food for you, and all that are in your houses.<br/><br/>
25. καὶ εἶπαν Σέσωκας ἡμᾶς, εὕρομεν χάριν ἐναντίον τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν καὶ ἐσόμεθα παῖδες Φαραω.<br/>And they said, You have saved us; we have found favour before our lord, and we will be servants to Pharao.<br/><br/>
26. καὶ ἔθετο αὐτοῖς Ιωσηφ εἰς πρόσταγμα ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης ἐπὶ γῆν Αἰγύπτου τῷ Φαραω ἀποπεμπτοῦν, χωρὶς τῆς γῆς τῶν ἱερέων μόνον· οὐκ ἦν τῷ Φαραω.<br/>And Joseph appointed it to them for an ordinance until this day; to reserve a fifth part for Pharao, on the land of Egypt, except only the land of the priests, that was not Pharao's.<br/><br/>
27. Κατῴκησεν δὲ Ισραηλ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς Γεσεμ καὶ ἐκληρονόμησαν ἐπ' αὐτῆς καὶ ηὐξήθησαν καὶ ἐπληθύνθησαν σφόδρα. -<br/>And Israel dwelt in Egypt, in the land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance upon it; and they increased and multiplied very greatly.<br/><br/>
28. ἐπέζησεν δὲ Ιακωβ ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ δέκα ἑπτὰ ἔτη· ἐγένοντο δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ιακωβ ἐνιαυτῶν τῆς ζωῆς αὐτοῦ ἑκατὸν τεσσαράκοντα ἑπτὰ ἔτη.<br/>And Jacob survived seventeen years in the land of Egypt; and Jacob's days of the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven years.<br/><br/>
29. ἤγγισαν δὲ αἱ ἡμέραι Ισραηλ τοῦ ἀποθανεῖν, καὶ ἐκάλεσεν τὸν υἱὸν αὐτοῦ Ιωσηφ καὶ εἶπεν αὐτῷ Εἰ εὕρηκα χάριν ἐναντίον σου, ὑπόθες τὴν χεῖρά σου ὑπὸ τὸν μηρόν μου καὶ ποιήσεις ἐπ' ἐμὲ ἐλεημοσύνην καὶ ἀλήθειαν τοῦ μή με θάψαι ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ,<br/>and the days of Israel drew nigh for him to die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If I have found favour before you, put your hand under my thigh, and you shall execute mercy and truth toward me, so as not to bury me in Egypt.<br/><br/>
30. ἀλλὰ κοιμηθήσομαι μετὰ τῶν πατέρων μου, καὶ ἀρεῖς με ἐξ Αἰγύπτου καὶ θάψεις με ἐν τῷ τάφῳ αὐτῶν. ὁ δὲ εἶπεν Ἑγὼ ποιήσω κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου.<br/>But I will sleep with my fathers, and you shall carry me up out of Egypt, and bury me in their sepulchre. And he said, I will do according to your word.<br/><br/>
31. εἶπεν δέ Ὄμοσόν μοι. καὶ ὤμοσεν αὐτῷ. καὶ προσεκύνησεν Ισραηλ ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ.<br/>And he said, Swear to me; and he swore to him. And Israel did reverence, leaning on the top of his staff.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/><br/>## 48<br/><br/>
1. Ἑγένετο δὲ μετὰ τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα καὶ ἀπηγγέλη τῷ Ιωσηφ ὅτι Ὁ πατήρ σου ἐνοχλεῖται. καὶ ἀναλαβὼν τοὺς δύο υἱοὺς αὐτοῦ, τὸν Μανασση καὶ τὸν Εφραιμ, ἦλθεν πρὸς Ιακωβ.<br/>And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, your father is ill; and, having taken his two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, he came to Jacob.<br/><br/>
2. ἀπηγγέλη δὲ τῷ Ιακωβ λέγοντες Ἰδοὺ ὁ υἱός σου Ιωσηφ ἔρχεται πρὸς σέ. καὶ ἐνισχύσας Ισραηλ ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ τὴν κλίνην.<br/>And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, your son Joseph is coming to you; and Israel having strengthened himself, sat upon the bed.<br/><br/>

4. καὶ εἶπέν μοι Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ αὐξανῶ σε καὶ πληθυνῶ σε καὶ ποιήσω σε εἰς συναγωγὰς ἐθνῶν καὶ δώσω σοι τὴν γῆν ταύτην καὶ τῷ σπέρματί σου μετὰ σὲ εἰς κατάσχεσιν αἰώνιον.<br/>and said to me, Behold, I will increase you, and multiply you, and will make of you multitudes of nations; and I will give this land to you, and to your seed after you, for an everlasting possession.<br/><br/>

6. τὰ δὲ ἔκγονα, ἃ ἐὰν γεννήσῃς μετὰ ταῦτα, σοὶ ἔσονται, ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τῶν ἀδελφῶν αὐτῶν κληθήσονται ἐν τοῖς ἐκείνων κλήροις.<br/>And the children which you shall beget hereafter, shall be in the name of their brethren; they shall be named after their inheritances.<br/><br/>

ὁ θεὸς ὁ τρέφων με ἐκ νεότητος ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ταύτης,
And he blessed them and said, The God in whose sight my fathers were well pleasing, [even] Abraam and Isaac, the God who continues to feed me from my youth until this day;
16. ὁ ἄγγελος ὁ ῥυόμενός με ἐκ πάντων τῶν κακῶν εὐλογήσαι τὰ παιδία ταῦτα,
καὶ ἐπικληθήσεται ἐν αὐτοῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῶν πατέρων μου Αβρααμ καὶ Ισαακ,
καὶ πληθυνθείησαν εἰς πλῆθος πολὺ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.<br/>the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on the earth.<br/><br/>
17. ἰδὼν δὲ Ιωσηφ ὅτι ἐπέβαλεν ὁ πατὴρ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Εφραιμ, βαρὺ αὐτῷ κατεφάνη, καὶ ἀντελάβετο Ιωσηφ τῆς χειρὸς τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ ἀφελεῖν αὐτὴν ἀπὸ τῆς κεφαλῆς Εφραιμ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν Μανασση.<br/>And Joseph having seen that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraim-- it seemed grievous to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse.<br/><br/>

19. καὶ οὐκ ἠθέλησεν, ἀλλὰ εἶπεν Οἶδα, τέκνον, οἶδα· καὶ οὗτος ἔσται εἰς λαόν, καὶ οὗτος ὑψωθήσεται, ἀλλὰ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ ὁ νεώτερος μείζων αὐτοῦ ἔσται, καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ ἔσται εἰς πλῆθος ἐθνῶν.<br/>And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.<br/><br/>
20. καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτοὺς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ λέγων
Ἑν ὑμῖν εὐλογηθήσεται Ισραηλ λέγοντες Ποιήσαι σε ὁ θεὸς ὡς Εφραιμ καὶ ὡς Μανασση·
καὶ ἔθηκεν τὸν Εφραιμ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Μανασση.<br/><br/>

And he blessed them in that day, saying, In you shall Israel be blessed, saying, God make you as Ephraim and Manasse; and he set Ephraim before Manasse.<br/><br/>
21. εἶπεν δὲ Ισραηλ τῷ Ιωσηφ Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἀποθνῄσκω, καὶ ἔσται ὁ θεὸς μεθ' ὑμῶν καὶ ἀποστρέψει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν γῆν τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν·<br/>And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die; and God shall be with you, and restore you to the land of your fathers.<br/><br/>

ὅτι ἐν τῷ θυμῷ αὐτῶν ἀπέκτειναν ἀνθρώπους
καὶ ἐν τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ αὐτῶν ἐνευροκόπησαν ταῦρον.<br/><br/>
